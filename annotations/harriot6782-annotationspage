Octonaria. Denaria. Octonary. Denary Rough sketch A full list of the numbers calculated in Add MS 6782 f.7 to f.10 . Blank page A geometric progression beginning from $ 9.988763... $ with multiplier $ \frac{1}{.999718...} $. It appears that Harriot has begun the calculations from the top of the table and worked downwards, and that rounding error has led him to $ 9.999999999999993 $ as the fifth entry rather than $ 10 $ as he would have expected. To the right, he has calculated first, second, third, and fourth differences. Rough work The same table as in Add MS 6782 f.3 , but now it appears that Harriot has begun the calculations from the fifth entry, $ 10 $, and worked both upwards and downwards from there. He has also calculated to 18 rather than merely 16 places. To the right, he has calculated first, second, third, and fourth differences. Blank page A shorter version of the table in Add MS 6782 f. 4 , calculated to 17 places. To the right, Harriot has calculated first, second, third, and fourth differences. Blank page The calculations $ \frac{1}{.99887...} = 1.000281... $ and $ \frac{.99941...}{.99887...} = 9.9887... $ were carried out on Add MS 6782 f. 10v and f. 11 . Here these, and further numbers, are presented as a geometric progression in which each number is obtained from the number above it by multiplying by $ .998718... $. Note that the numbers labelled 1, 2, and 4 were originally calculated as square roots in Add MS 6782 f. 9 and f. 9v . To the right, Harriot has calculated first, second, third, and fourth differences. For other versions of this table see Add MS 6782 f. 3 , f. 4 , f. 5 . f.c.10) Blank page This is the first of several pages of calculations of what are essentially fractional powers of 10. Harriot used large integers to avoid fractional parts, but the calculation at the top of the page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10} = {10}^{\frac{1}{2}} = 3.1622... $. The calculation in the lower half of the page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{10}} = {10}^{\frac{3}{4}} = 5.6234... $. fc.1. Continuing from Add MS 6782 f. 7 , and following the same pattern, the calculations on this page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{15}{16}}}} = {10}^{\frac{31}{32}} = 9.3057... $ and $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{31}{32}}}} = {10}^{\frac{63}{64}} = 9.6466... $. fc.3.) Continuing from Add MS 6782 f. 7 , and following the same pattern, the calculations on this page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{3}{4}}}} = {10}^{\frac{7}{8}} = 7.4989... $ and $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{7}{8}}}} = {10}^{\frac{15}{16}} = 8.6596... $. fc.2.) Continuing from Add MS 6782 f. 7 , and following the same pattern, the calculations on this page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{63}{64}}}} = {10}^{\frac{127}{128}} = 9.8217... $ and $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{127}{128}}}} = {10}^{\frac{255}{256}} = 9.9104... $. fc.4.) Continuing from Add MS 6782 f. 7 , and following the same pattern, the calculations on this page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{255}{256}}}} = {10}^{\frac{511}{512}} = 9.9551... $ and $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{511}{512}}}} = {10}^{\frac{1023}{1024}} = 9.9775... $. fc.5.) Continuing from Add MS 6782, f. 7, and following the same pattern, the calculation on this page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{4095}{4096}}}} = {10}^{\frac{8191}{1928}} = 9.9971... $. fc.7.) Continuing from Add MS 6782 f. 7 , and following the same pattern, the calculations on this page may be interpreted as $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{1023}{1024}}}} = {10}^{\frac{2047}{2048}} = 9.9887... $ and $ \sqrt{10 \times \sqrt{{10}^{\frac{2047}{2048}}}} = {10}^{\frac{4095}{4096}} = 9.9943... $. fc.6.) The calculations on this page may be interpreted as $ \frac{1}{.99887...} = 1.000281... $. (See also Add MS 6782, f. 26, for the same calculation.) fc.8.) The calculations on this page may be interpreted as $ \frac{.99941...}{.99887...} = 9.9887... $. fc.9.) Blank page Across the top of the page are the terms of a geometric progression with multiplier $ \frac{a}{b} $. The rest of the page contains a table of successive squares of the number that may be interpreted as $ .99999999998877 $. Selected powers are then added to give $ .99999999998877^{25920000} $. A calculation on the following page, Add MS 6782 f. 13 , shows that $ 25920000 = 2 \times 60^4 $, that is, the number of half-fifths of a degree in a minute (where a degree is subdivided in the traditional way into minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths by successive divisions by 60). The entries in the table are calculated in the subsequent pages labelled c.2 to c.7; see: 'Spirals, series c' . c.1.) $ = am $ in charta (ca.1.) Sheet ca.1 is HMC MS 240.v f. 419 . Blank page The calculation in the upper left corner shows the number of seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths in a minute of a degree. The number of fifths (12960000) is then doubled to give the number of half-fifths (25920000). In the upper right corner, Harriot calculates that if 1 minute is represented by 1 mile, a half-fifth of a degree would be represented by $ \frac{1}{432} $ of an inch, a distance that, as he observes, would be invisible. c.1.) 1000 pases = 1' or mile = 5000 feet = 60,000 yinches $ \frac{1}{432} $ ynch is the quantity of $ \frac{1}{2} $ fifths which is invisible. Blank page Here Harriot devises a method of squaring .99999999997755 by treating it as $ 1.00000000000000 - 0.00000000010000 + 0.00000000007755 $. After carrying out the first calculation in full, he sees that he can shorten the method by neglecting very small terms. He also sees another short cut by letting $ f = c - d $. He continues squaring until he reaches $ .99999999856320 $. c.2.) Rough work Harriot continues from the previous page, Add MS 6782 f. 14 , successively squaring until he reaches $ .99999995402240 $. c.3.)

Blank page The numbers in the broad central column, above the horizontal dividing line, form a decreasing geometric progression. Harriot used large integers to avoid fractional parts, but if the first number is interpreted as 100, the succeeding numbers down to the dividing line represent $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{15}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{14}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{13}{16}} $, ... $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{2}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^0 $. The numbers below the dividing line may be interpreted in a similar way as $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{32}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{64}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{1128}} $, ... $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{2048}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{4096}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{8192}} $. The numbers marked with asterisks from $ 31.622... $ downwards have been calculated as successive square roots in sheets paginated fb.1 to fb.6, in Add MS 6782 f. 23 to f. 25 . Those marked with asterisks in the upper part of the table can be calculated as reciprocals of those in the lower part. The numbers in the narrow left-hand column, above the horizontal dividing line, form an increasing arithmetic progression with common difference 512. (In the narrow right-hand column, part of the same progression is shown in reverse order.) Thus Harriot has matched an arithmetic progression with common difference 512 to a geometric progression with common ratio $ \frac{1}{{10}^{\frac{1}{16}}} $. The matching continues in finer detail below the dividing line for the entries in the geometric progression between $ 11.5478... $ and $ 10 $. Such a matching, between an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression, is the foundation of any system of logarithms. Harriot notes that calculating the numbers in the central column as terms in a geometric progression can lead to differences in the final figures as compared with calculating them as square roots. The number $ 31,622... $ halfway down the column is written here as it was found by calculation in Add MS 6782 f. 7 , with the final figures $ ... 683,79 $. Calculating the same entry by multiplication, as part of a geometric progression, has instead given Harriot the final figures as $ ... 683,76 $. Similar discrepancies are noted elsewhere. fb.1.)

Blank page A word square based on the words HENRICUS PRINCEPS FECIT (Prince Henry made it). The number 184,756 appears four times in the bottom right. In each quarter of the square, there are 184,756 ways of reading HENRICUS PRINCEPS FECIT, starting from the centre and ending at a corner. Thus there are 739,024 ways in total. This number may have been written on the page but has now disappeared (see Add MS 6782 f. 28 for a similar calculation). For the calculations leading to 184,756 see Add MS 6782 f. 57 and f. 58 . Blank page A word square based on the words SILO PRINCEPS FECIT (Prince Silo made it). A $ 15 \times 19 $ rectangular version of this arrangement, carved in stone, is to be found in the church of San Juan Apostol y Evangelista in Santianes de Pravia, northern Spain, commemorating Silo, king of Asturias (774 to 783). The number 12,780 appears four times in the bottom left hand corner of the page. In each quarter of the square, there are 12,780 ways of reading SILO PRINCEPS FECIT, starting from the centre and ending at a corner. Thus there are 51,480 ways in total. For the calculations leading to 12,780 see Add MS 6782 f. 57 and f. 58 . Blank page This folio shows calculations for solving the equation $ 1z + 3a = 276 $ (in modern notation $ x^2 + 3x = 276 $). Triangular numbers arranged as dot patterns. The arrangement of Pascal's triangle on the right shows how each row is obtained by summing two copies of the preceding row. The upper left quarter of the page contains two versions of Pascal's triangle, in different layouts. The upper right quarter shows the entries of the triangle generated by successive multiplications of $ (b + c) $. The lower right quarter shows the entries of the triangle generated by successive multiplications of $ (1 + 1) $. The lower left quarter demonstrates, following from the multiplications on the right, that the entries in each row sum to a power of 2. De combinationibus On combinations To serve ones turne. To do one a sound turne. This page contains rough work on combinations of the letters $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, $ d $. It also shows the numerals from 1 to 9 written with a medieval form for '4', and as figures composed only of straight lines. The reference to 'Saxton's great map' is to Christopher Saxton's county maps for England and Wales, published from 1579 onwards (Saxton 1579) . Units of measurement: a pase or pace (from Latin passus) was the length of a double stride, about 5 feet or 1.5 metres. Thus one square pase was 25 square feet. The Roman mile was 1000 pases.

That in every 40 yeares there is (one time with an other) as I have proved in an other page (& agreeth with Nombers .26.64 a new generation. Therefore in 6000 yeares there are 150 generations. Therefore there have been of persons in 6000 yeres $ 7,000,000,000 \times 150 = 1,050,000,000,000 $. persons. There being 50,000 miles square in England; therefore there may stand in England 300,000,000,000. persons. The former number is three times greater, & therefore there place of standing must be also 3 times greater then England. Another copy of the table shown on Add MS 6782 f. 63 . Blank page This folio gives systematic lists of all combinations (without repetition) of the letters $ a $, $ ab $, $ abc $, $ abcd $, $ abcde $, $ abcdef $. In each case the combinations are listed as single letters, pairs, triples, and so on. Combinations of the same size are listed alphabetically, thus $ abc $, $ abd $, and so on. (In the final column the triples are to be read downwards from $ abc $ to $ aef $ then back up from $ bef $ to $ def $.) Numbers written to the right of the columns show the number of combinations in each part of the list. Totals are given at the bottom. A table mid-left lists numbers of the form $ 2^{n - 1} $ and $ 2^{n + 1} - 1 $ from $ n = 1 $. The latter are the numbers that appear as totals. A table lower left shows how combinations of $ abc $ may be derived from those for $ ab $ by adding $ c $ to the end of each of them and then also listing $ c $ as a singleton. Of combinations Blank page This folio gives systematic lists of all combinations (without repetition) of $ a $, $ ab $, $ abc $, $ abcd $, $ abcde $, $ abcdef $. In each case the combinations are listed as single letters, pairs, triples, and so on. Combinations of the same kind are listed alphabetically, thus $ abc $, $ abd $, and so on. Numbers written to the right of the columns show the number of combinations in each part of the list. Of combinations Blank page This folio shows combinations (without repetition) of $ a $, $ ab $, $ abc $, $ abcd $, with each list constructed from the previous one. Combinations of $ abcd $, for example, are found from combinations of $ abc $ by adding $ d $ to each of them, together with $ d $ as a singleton. Numbers to the right of each column show the number of combinations in each part of the list. Totals are given at the bottom. Harriot uses the word 'complications' for combinations of more than one letter, and 'simples' for single letters. At the end of the page Harriot reaches the conclusion that if null combinations are counted, then the total number of combinations will be a power of 2. Of combinations By this manner of construction & generation of the variety of combinations or complications: these propositions are manifest: The nomber of complications with the nomber of there simples: is double to the nomber of complications with there simples, of the next praecedent order: & one more. In any order of complications: The nomber of Bynaryes Ternaryes Quaternaries &c. is æquall to the nomber, in the precedent order, of: Binaryes & Simples. Ternaryess & Binaryes. Quaternaryes & Ternaryes. & c. Hereby is also manifest, the reason & order of the construction of the table of combinations by nombers which followeth is set downe in an other paper. In some cases rationall or negative is added: as of the species $ ab $. question may be made whether an other thing hath acte upon. $ a $. or $ b $. or both that is $ ab $. or neither. And such negatives may be understode of all the rest. And thus the sommes of every order wilbe one more; and there progression wilbe. 2. 4. 8. 16. 32. &c. $ z $ is $ a $, or not. $ z $ is $ a $. or $ b $. or $ ab $. or not. $ z $ is $ a $. or $ b $. or $ c $. or $ ab $. or $ ac $. or $ bc $. or $ abc $. or not. &c. Rough work Columns 1 to 10 of Pascal's triangle, continued in the lower half of the page as far as column 18. The table is continued to column 24 on Add MS 6782 f. 37 . Of combinations These nombers are also the nombers which are used for the extraction of rootes. Blank page Pascal's triangle as far as column 24, continued from Add MS 6782 f. 36 . Of combinations Rough work On this page, as on Add MS 6782 f. 36 , Harriot recognizes the usefulness of the triangular numbers both for calculating numbers of combinations and for extraction of roots. In the note in the bottom right hand corner of the page, Harriot mentions Boethius, Jordanus, and Maurolico as writers on figurate numbers. His source for both Boethius and Jordanus was probably Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples (Jacob Faber Stapulensis), Epitome, compendiosaque introductio in libros arithmeticos diui Severini Boetij (1503, 1522), which includes a comparison of the 'De institutione' of Boethius with the 'De arithmetica' of Jordanus. His source for Maurolico was the Arithmeticorum libri duo (Maurolico 1575) , which he cited several times elsewhere. Of combinations A Generall rule to get the mayne summe of all the complications of any Nomber of Species without the table of combinations. According to the nomber of species: understand as many termes to be gotten in continuall proportion or progression, beginning at a unite & making every terme double to his precedent: the double of the last terme lesse by a unite is the summe desired. or the somme of the progression. As for example. I wold know all the complications of 6. species. together with the nomber of the simples. the sixth terme of such a progression I spake of, is 32. therefore The double lesse by a unite is 63, is the summe of all the the complications with the nomber of simples which were sought. If the number of species be greate; the last terme desired is to be gotten by the rule of progression in arithmeticke. The reason of the rule is easily to be conceaved out of the particular constructions in an other paper annexed. The 'other paper' referred to here is probably Add MS 6782 f. 331 . A Generall methode for the particular summes of complications : As for example of 6. I would know all first in 6 there are 6 diverse simple species. Then I wold know how many complications of 2 wilbe found in 6; also how many of 3. & 4. &c. The Theoreme for the rule is this: As 2 hath in proportion to the second nomber from the nomber of species towardes a unite: so hath the nomber of variety of unites to the somme of the complications of 2. And as 3 hath in proportion to the third nomber from the nomber of species towardes a unite: so hath the nomber of variety of compli- cations of 2, last gotten; to the somme of the complications of 3. & so forth, generally as wilbe manifest by the example following. An example for 20. The practice is playne. The theoreme is to be demonstrated out of Boetius or Maurolicus, & I thinke Jordanus. by the doctrine of genera- ting triangular nombers & of triangular, piramidal. & of piramidal, triangle- pyramidal &c. And is worth the noting for some other respects especially of generating for getting the nomber of complicity that belongs to any dignityes for extracting there roote; seeing those nombers are the very same. Rough work By 'transpositions' Harriot means what we would now call permutations. His 'single variations' are what we would now call cyclic permutations. For simple diagrams illustrating cyclic permutations see Add MS 6782 f. 43v and f. 225v . On this folio he lists all possible permutations of $ a $, $ ab $, $ abc $, and $ abcd $, and begins a list for $ abcde $. Of Transpositions Single variations. They are so many as there are species. The nomber of transpositions of any nomber of species being given: The nomber of transpositions of the next nomber of species, is a nomber that riseth of there multiplication. For: suppose the nomber of transpositions of 3 species, that is $ abc $, to be 6. The next nomber to be transposed is 4. which let be $ abcd $. Now $ d $, in respect of $ abc $ hath foure places. that is he may be next after $ c $: after $ b $: after $ a $: or before $ a $. So many places it hath with $ acb $, & the rest of the 6. Therefore 4 times 6, which is 24. is the nomber of transpositions of 4 species. The like reason is of all others that may follow in infinitum. Transpositions of: Number of Termes of variations Sume of the species totall Blank page This small table shows all the combinations and permutations of up to 7 letters. The figures in the column under 7, for example, show all the combinations of 7 single letters (7), all the combinations of 2 letters ($ 7 \times 6 = 42 $), of 3 letters ($ 7 \times 6 \times 5 = 210 $), and so on. Lines drawn between columns show how figures in a given column are obtained from those in the preceding column. The figures in column 7, for example, are obtained from those in column 6 by multiplying by 7. combinations & transpositions together. Tables showing the most likely sums on 5 dice, or on 6 dice (totals only). The left hand table is a frequency table for the sums on five dice, constructed by adding copies of the columns of table (v) from Add MS 6782 f. 40 (just as table (v) there was constructed from table (iv). The two right hand columns are a frequency table for the sums on six dice. Here the individual columns that make up the sum have not been written down but the additions have been carried out in the working at the bottom of the page. In the table itself Harriot has written only the totals. As on Add MS 6782 f. 40 , the most likely sums are marked with crosses. The two words 'on dice' in the title are written in Harriot's Algonquin alphabet (see Add MS 6782 f. 337 ). The two tables at the top of the page show the sums that can be obtained on (i) two dice (sums ranging from 2 to 12) or (ii) three dice (sums ranging from 3 to 18). The three tables in the lower part of the page are frequency tables for the sums on (iii) two dice; (iv) three dice ; (v) four dice. Tables (iii) and (iv) can be calculated directly from (i) and (ii). However, the layout shows that (iv) can also be calculated by taking copies of the totals from (iii), staggering their starting position, and then adding; this is equivalent to taking the totals from (iii) and then adding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, in turn to represent the throw of the third dice. For each of (iii), (iv), and (v) the most likely sums are marked with a small cross.

Rough work relating to sums on dice This folio quotes some text from Girolamo Cardano, Opus novum de proportionibus (Cardano 1570, 187) , Proposition 170. The copy is in an unknown hand. The table below the text is exactly as given by Cardano. Cardanus de proportionibus. prop. 170. Ut autem habeas numeros singulorum ordinum, in quavis multitudino, deducito numerum ordinis a primo, & divide per numerum ordinis ipsius reliquum, et illud quod proventi, ducito in numerum maximum praecedentis ordinis, et habebis numerum quaesitum. Velut si sint undecim, volo scire breviter numeros, qui fiunt ex variatione trium. Primum deduco pro secundo ordine 1 ex 11 fit 10, divido per 2 numerum ordinis, exit 5, duco in 11 fit 55 numerus secundi ordinis. Inde detraho 2, qui est numerus differentiae ordinis totij a primo ex 11, relinquitur 9, divido 9 per 3 numerum ordinis exit 3, duco 3 in 55 numerum secundi fit 165, numerus totij ordinis. Similiter volo numerum variatione quatuor, dedco 3 differentiam 4 a primo ordine ab 11 relinquitur 8, divido 8 per 4 numero ordinis, exit 2, duco 2 in 195 fit 330, numeri quarti ordinis.

As moreover you have the numbers of a single row, of any size, you can derive the numbers of each place from the first, and divide by the number of the place, and what arises multiply by the greatest number of the preceding place,and you will have the number sought. Thus if there are eleven objects, I want to know quickly the number that arises for three choices. First, for the second place, I take 1 from 11 which makes 10, I divide by 2, the number of the place, there comes out 5, I multiply by 11 to make 55, the number of the second place. Next I subtract 2, which is the number of the difference of all the places from the first, from 11, there remains 9, I divide 9 by 3, the number of the place, there comes out 3, I multiply 3 by 55, the second number, to make 165, the number in the third place. Similarly if I want the number for four choices, I take 3, the difference of 4 from the first place, from 11, there is left 8, I divide 8 by 4, the number of the place, there comes out 2, I multiply 2 by 165 to make 330, the number of the fourth place. Similarly for the fifth I subtract 4, the difference from the first place, there remains 7, I divide by 5, the number of the place, there comes out $ 1\frac{2}{5} $, I multiply by 330, the number of the previous place, to make 462, the number of the fifth place. Rough work on permutations, including diagrams for cyclic permutations This folio appears to deal with 6 dice numbered as follows: first die: 0 0 0 0 0 1 second die: 0 0 0 0 0 2 third die: 0 0 0 0 0 3 fourth die: 0 0 0 0 0 4 fifth die: 0 0 0 0 0 5 sixth die: 0 0 0 0 0 6 The tables show the possible outcomes of throwing the first, then the first and the second, then the first and the second and the third, and so on. In the table for six dice, for example, we see that combinations with one 0 and five other numbers can appear in $ 5 \times 6 = 30 $ ways (since any of the five zeros can appear in any of the six positions). Squeezed below and between the main tables are frequency tables showing how many times each sum can appear. For six dice, for example, we see that the total 3 can arise in two ways (as 1 + 2 or as 0 + 3) giving 3,750 possibilities in total. In each of these tables the number of possibilities is summed, giving the appropriate power of 6 in each case.

The letters $ p $, $ m $, $ f $, $ s $, $ a $ stand for pondus (weight), magnitudo (magnitude), figura (area), situs (place), altitudo (altitude) (see Add MS 6786 f. 291 ). The tables on this folio appear to have been begun at the top left but then re-started and continued along the right-hand edge. The tables are calculated in turn for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 throws of a die. Take, for example, the fourth table, for four throws of a die. The first row indicates that the combination 1111 can occur in only one way. The next two rows indicate how many ways only 1 and 2 can occur, distributed as either 3 + 1 (thus, 1112, 1121, 1211, 2111, 2221, 2212, 2122, 1222), that is, $ 2 \times 4 = 8 $ ways in total, or as 2 + 2 (thus, 1122, 1212, 1221, 2112, 2121, 2211), that is, 3 + 3 = 6 ways in total. These two calculations are shown in full on Add MS 6782 f. 50v . The fourth row indicates how many ways only 1, 2, and 3 can occur, with any one of them appearing twice (thus 1123, 1132, 1212, 3112, ...), that is, $ 4 \times 3 \times 3 = 36 $ ways in total. Further details of the calculation are shown on Add MS 6782 f. 50v . The fifth and final row indicates how many ways 1, 2, 3, 4 can appear, that is, $ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24 $ ways in total. All the other tables are calculated in a similar way. Several of the calculations can be seen on Add MS 6782 f. 50v . Below the line (still reading the page sideways) are two further tables; for the continuation of these, see Add MS 6782 f. 50 . Harriot also includes some brief notes to explain how the tables have been derived. 11112 variatur per: 11112 may be varied by: conversionem, ut 22221. conversion, as 22221. transpositionem, 11112, 11121, 11211, 12111, 21111 transposition, 11112, 11121, 11211, 12111, 21111 coniugationum ut supra sunt 2 ex 6; sunt 15ies conjugation, as there are 2 out of 6, there are 15 ways Blank page On this folio Harriot uses the totals he has arrived at on Add MS 6782 f. 49 , but now extends the calculations to all six numbers on the die. As for Add MS 6783, f. 49, we will once again examine the fourth table. The first row indicates that a given number can be appear four times in just one way; but the given number can be chosen in six ways, so there are $ 1 \times 6 = 6 $ such combinations in total. The second row indicates that any two numbers can occur together, with 3 of one and 1 of the other, in 8 ways (as calculated on Add MS 6783 f. 49 ,); but two numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} $), so there are $ 8 \times 5 = 120 $ such combinations in total. The third row indicates that any two numbers can occur together, with 2 of one and 2 of the other, in 6 ways (as calculated on Add MS 6783 f. 49 ,); but two numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} $), so there are $ 6 \times 15 = 90 $ such combinations in total. The fourth row indicates that any three numbers can occur together in 36 ways (as calculated on Add MS 6783 f. 49 ,); but three numbers can be chosen from six in 20 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} $), so there are $ 36 \times 20 = 720 $ such combinations in total. The fifth row indicates that any four numbers can occur together in 24 ways (as calculated on Add MS 6783 f. 49 ,); but four numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} $), so there are $ 24 \times 15 = 360 $ such combinations in total. As a check on the calculations, Harriot has calculated powers of 6 on the same page. It is easily seen from this that each table includes all the possibilities for that number of throws.

The table at the top left shows the number of pathways from centre to corner for squares of size $ 1 \times 1 $ to $ 21 \times 21 $. For a $ 5 \times 5 $ square, for instance, there are 20 pathways to each corner, and so 80 in all. (There is an error in the calculation for $ 9 \times 9 $ squares, where there are 70 pathways to each corner, making a total of 280 in all, not 240.) Below the table are the numbers of pathways for the squares on Add MS 6782 f. 28 and f. 27 , SILO PRINCEPS FECIT (17 letters, 51,480 pathways) and HENRICUS PRINCEPS FECIT (21 letters, 739,024 pathways).

Rough work: sketch Blank word square Blank page Blank word square Blank page In this page. Harriot begins by constructing a table of the interest paid after seven years on a capital sum of £$ bb $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{b} $. The first row shows the total if the interest is paid yearly (7 payments). The second row shows the total if interest is paid twice a year (14 payments). The third row shows the total if interest is paid three times a year (21 payments). From here, Harriot immediately generalizes to $ n $ payments per year. He then (implicitly) allows $ n $ to become very large, indeed infinitely large, so that the fractions $ \frac{(n - 1)n}{nn} $, $ \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)n}{nnn} $, ... can all be taken to be 1. Harriot then substitutes $ b = 10 $ to obtain the interest on £100 at a rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $, paid continuously over seven years. The total comes to £201 7 shillings and 6 pence, plus a further fraction that he estimates is not quite $ \frac{7}{100} $ pence. (There were 20 shillings (s) to £1, and 12 pence (d) to 1 shillling.) This page combines the calculations on the nearby f. 68 (interest on £$ b $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{b} $, paid at decreasing intervals) with those on f. 69 (interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ paid at decreasing intervals and taken to a limit.

Below the rough work crossed out at the top are calculations of interest on £$ bb $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{b} $. The first table shows the interest paid every year for seven years. The words continue proportionales (continued proportionals) indicate that each row is obtained by multiplication from the previous row. The multiplier from each row to the next is $ (1 + \frac{1}{b}) $. The second table shows a similar calculation but now interest is added twice yearly and the multiplier is $ (1 + \frac{1}{2b}) $. The table shows only the first four entries and then the total after 7 years. The third table repeats the calculation but now interest is added three times yearly and the multiplier is $ (1 + \frac{1}{3b}) $. The table shows only the first three entries and then the total after 7 years. yeres continue proportionales continued proportionals Rough work relating to 'Interest upon interest'. After the rough work crossed out at the top, the table show the calculation of interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $, paid every year for five years. The next section is crossed out but the reader is referred by asterisk to an expression lower down the page. Here Harriot has written a general formula for the interest paid on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ after $ n $ years. In the next calculation Harriot has assumed that $ n $ is infinitely large, so that the fractions $ \frac{(n - 1)n}{nn} $, $ \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)n}{nnn} $, ... can all be taken to be 1. Thus he obtains the interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ paid continuously. In calculating the sum, Harriot has drawn a vertical line that cuts off the calculation after 6 terms. He notes underneath that £$ \frac{1}{60} = 4 $d (4 pence), that £$ \frac{1}{2400} = \frac{1}{10}$d, and that the sum of all the remaining terms will not make up as much as $ \frac{2}{10} $d. yeares The summe of interest upon interest continually for every instant the whole yeare with the principall of 100£ after the rate of 10 in ye 100 for the yeare. not $ \frac{2}{10} $ d Rough work relating to 'Interest upon interest'. The tables in the first row show the calculation of interest on £$ b $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ for four years.

The tables in the third row show the calculation of interest on £$ b $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{40} $ for four years. The tables in the last row show the calculation of interest on £$ b $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{c} $ for seven years. The words continue proportionales (continued proportionals) next to the final table indicate that each row is obtained by multiplication from the previous row.

Blank page At the beginning of this set of sheets Harriot has written: 'Waste papers of figurate nombers'. They are waste only in the sense that they contain rough working. At the same time, they show Harriot attempting something highly original, namely, finding formulae for sequences of figurate numbers. In modern terms, we would say he is fitting third-, fourth- or fifth-degree polynomials to numerical sequences. At the top is the sequence 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... of sums of squares (or of square-pyramidal numbers, see Add MS 6782 f. 155 ). Just below that, Harriot has written the polynomial $ 2aaaa + 9aaa + 11a + 2a $, which, it seems, is his first attempt to find a formula for the numbers in the sequence, multiplied by 24 (that is, 24, 120, 336, ...). Putting $ a = 1 $ gives $ 2 + 9 + 11 + 2 $, as required. Putting $ a = 2 $, however, gives $ 2 \times 16 + 9 \times 8 + 11 + 4 + 2 \times 4 = 152 $, which is too large. This calculation can be seen displayed vertically just below the formula. Harriot notes that $ 6 \times 24 = 144 $ falls short of this total by 8. Similar trial and error calculations appear on this and several pages that follow. Waste papers. of figurate nombers. Trials similar to those on Add MS 6782 f. 74 , but now for the polynomial $ 6a + 11aa + 6aaa + aaaa $, represented by the coefficients 6, 11, 6, 1. This is evaluated for $ a = 3 $, giving $ 360 = 24 \times 15 $; for $ a = 5 $, giving $ 1680 = 24 \times 70 $; and (lower right) for for $ a = 2 $, giving $ 120 = 24 \times 5 $. It seems Harriot is still trying to fit the sequence 1, 5, 14, 30, ..., which appears again alongside the coefficients 6, 11, 6, 1 on Add MS 6782 f. 76v .

On this folio Harriot appears to be searchng for a formula for the sequence 1, 6, 20, 50, ... of sums of square-pyramidal numbers (see Add MS 6782 f. 155 ), or rather, for those numbers multiplied 24, that is, 24, 144, 480, ... . Examples on the left hand side of the page test the polynomial $ 8a + 4aa + 10aaa + 2aaaa $ (note that 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24). This is evaluated for $ a = 2 $, giving 144 (as required) and for $ a = 3 $, giving 492 (too large). Examples in the bottom left hand corner rearrange the same coefficients in different orders: (2, 10, 8, 4), (8, 10, 2, 4), (8, 2, 10, 4), etc. In examples further to the right, the fifth-degree polynomial $ 24a + 50aa + 35aaa + 10aaaa + aaaaa $, represented by the coefficients 24, 50, 35, 10, 1, is evaluated for $ a = 2 $, giving 640, and for $ a = 3 $ giving 2520. This page shows further attempts, as on Add MS 6782 f. 77 , to find coefficients that deliver 24 (when $ a = 1 $), 144 (when $ a = 2 $), and 480 (when $ a = 3 $).

For this he needs polynomials of the fifth degree. Rough work on fitting polynomials The first reference in the heading is to Michael Stifel's Arithmetica integra (Stifel 1544) , page 15. For Stifel, a diagonal number was obtained by multiplying the first two entries of a Pythagorean triple. The diagonal number corresponding to the triple (3, 4, 5), for example, is $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $. Stifel also defined Pythagorean triples by the ratio of the two shorter sides, in this case $ \frac{4}{3} $. He was able to write out two lists, or orders, of triples, one with the shorter side odd ($ \frac{4}{3} $, $ \frac{12}{5} $, and so on), the other with the shorter side even ($ \frac{15}{8} $, $ \frac{35}{12} $, and so on). Stifel claimed that all possible triples were included in these two orders. The second reference in the heading, possibly added a little later, is to Johannes Praetorius (Johann Richter), Problema, quod iubet ex quatuor rectis lineis datis quadrilaterum fieri, quod sit in circulo (Praetorius 1598) . On the final page, Praetorius discusses the problem of constructing cyclic quadrilaterals with rational sides. Harriot sets out to disprove Stifel's claim, by demonstrating the existence of new orders of triples. His first order (ordo. 1.) is the same as Stifel's first order. The triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. This allows Harriot to extrapolate forwards, but also backwards to a starting triple (1, 0, 1). The second order (ordo. 2.) is the same as Stifel's second order. Again the triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. As for the first order this allows Harriot to extrapolate backwards to a starting triple (4, 3, 5). This is the first triple of the first order with the first two entries interchanged. Perhaps this gave Harriot the idea of interchanging other pairs. Thus he begins a third and new order (ordo. 3. novus) with (12, 5, 8), which is the second triple from the first order with the first two entries interchanged. This order immediately contains (20, 21, 29), which was not included in either of Stifel's orders. The fourth order begins with (15, 8, 17), which is the first triple from the second order with the first two entries interchanged. And so on. By the end of the page, Harriot has six orders, with differences in the left column of 2, 4, 8, 6, 10, 12, respectively. This seems to suggest to him a more systematic method of displaying the orders, which he goes on to do on the next page.

Hypotenusorum progressio A progression of the hypotenuses On this folio the orders discovered on the previous sheet (Add MS 6782 f. 84 ) are listed systematically. Each new order begins with the second triple from the previous order, with the first two entries interchanged. At the bottom of the page, Harriot notes the starting differences for each order. He has also written the enigmatic note Hic sunt omnes primi sed hic omnes non sunt primi which was greatly to confuse his friend Nathaniel Torporley when he came across it some years later.

For a detailed account of the history and the mathematics of the treatise that follows, see Beery and Stedall 2009 . De Numeris Triangularibus et inde De progressionibus Arithmeticis Magisteria magna T. H. On triangular numbers and thence artihmetic progressions The great doctrine of Thomas Harriot. Blank page Throughout the treatise that follows, $ n $ is to be read as a positive integer. The table at the top of the page is an array of general triangular numbers: the first row and first column contain units, the second row and second column contain lengths, the third row and third column contain triangular numbers, the fourth row and fourth column contain pyramidal numbers, and so on. Between the numbers are signs that combine 'plus' and 'equals', illustrating the additive property of the table. The numerators and denominators of the fractions are to be read as products. Thus $ \frac{789,10,11}{12345} $ in the bottom right-hand corner, for example, is to be read as $ \frac{7 \times 8 \times 9 \times 10 \times 11}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5} = 924 $. Below the tables Harriot has written general formulae for the numbers in the $ n $th row. 1.) Blank page The formulae from page 1 (Add MS 6782 f. 108 ) are expanded by long multiplication, with each formula used as a starting point for the next. The formula in the second box, for example, is obtained from the formula in the first box, by multiplying by $ (n + 2) $ and dividing by 3 (as also instructed by Cardano, see Add MS 6782 f. 44 ). 2.) Blank page In the table at the top of the page, the triangular numbers from page 1 (Add MS 6782 f. 108 ) are rearranged into a triangular pattern, with the sum of each row on the right. In the next table, each entry from the top table is written as a fraction, as on page 1 . Below the table are general formulae for the entries in the $ (n + 1) $th row. 3.) Blank page The formulae from the bottom of page 3 (Add MS 6782 f. 110 ), expanded by long multiplication. 4.) Blank page At the top of the page are two difference tables. In each case column headed $ g $ may be taken as the starting column. Column $ f $ contains successive differences between entries in column $ g $, and so on. As elsewhere, a triangle broadening downwards thus, Δ, indicates an increasing column. A small square is used to indicate columns of equal entries. The central table shows a difference table generated from a constant differenc $ a $. Now the lower case letters $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, $ d $, $ f $ represent the first entry of each column (the letter $ e $, which for Harriot represented an un unknown quantity, is omitted). Harriot has drawn a diagonal line under the table generated from a single entry in the constant difference column. Two small inset charts to the right of the main table show the pattern of increasing and decreasing rows (here they are all increasing) and the pattern of signs in each column (here they are all $ + $). The lower table contains general formulae for the $ (n + 1) $th entry in each column of the difference table, using the triangular number coefficients established on page 3 (Add MS 6782 f. 110 ). 5.) Blank page As on page 5 (Add MS 6782 f. 112 ), this page begins with two difference tables, but now the columns headed $ c $ and $ f $ are decreasing, indicated by a triangle narrowing downwards. As on page 5, the central table contains formulae for the individual entries. The two small inset charts to the right of the main table show the pattern of increasing and decreasing rows (here they are alternately increasing and decreasing) and the pattern of signs in each column. The lower table contains general formulae for the $ (n + 1) $th entry in each column of the difference table, using the triangular number coefficients established on page 3 (Add MS 6782 f. 110 ). 6.) Blank page Page 7 is similar to page 6 (Add MS 6782 f. 113 ), except for a change in the pattern of increasing and decreasing columns. The difference table at the top right contains a rare error: the last entry of column $ f $ should be 1031 not 1030. 7.) Blank page Here Harriot has listed all possible patterns of increasing (c) and decreasing (d) columns for difference tables of up to six columns. In the lower half of the page, Harriot has produced 32 charts, like those on pages 5 to 7 (Add MS 6782 f. 111 to f. 113 ), showing the sign patterns in the column entries, for each pattern of increasing and decreasing columns, for up to six columns. The symbols above charts 1 and 32, which look rather like $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $, are Harriot's symbols for tangents and secants. The symbol $ \upsilon $ above tables 11 and 22 is his symbol for sines. In each case, the patterns of c and d columns are those required for the corresponding trigonometric tables. 8.) Blank page This page shows general entries in a difference table with six columns, generated from 24 entries in the constant difference column. As on page 5 (Add MS 6782 f. 112 ), a diagonal line has been drawn below the entries generated from just one entry in the constant difference column. 9.) Blank page The left hand side of the page contains a difference table with increasing columns, generated from a constant difference 2. In the first table on the right, the column headed $ G $ contains every third entry (denoted by the note $ n = 3 $) from the column headed $ g $. In the second table on the right, the column headed $ F $ contains every second entry (denoted by the note $ n = 2 $) from the column headed $ f $. The other three tables on the right are constructed in a similar way. 10.) Blank page This folio is very similar to the previous one (Add MS 6782 f. 117 ). 11.) Blank page This folio is similar to the previous two (Add MS 6782 f. 117 and f. 118 ) except for a different pattern of increasing and decreasing columns. 12.) Blank page This folio is similar to the previous one (Add MS 6782 f. 119 ) except for the opposite pattern of increasing and decreasing columns. 13.) Blank page On the right hand side of the page are three partial difference tables from earlier pages; the first and third tables are from page 10 (Add MS 6782 f. 117 ) while the second is from page 11 (Add MS 6782 f. 121 ). In each case, Harriot has also listed the first entries of the columns of the original difference table, denoted by $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, and $ d $. On the left hand side are algebraic versions of the same partial difference tables. The first table gives formulae for successive second entries of the column beginning with $ d $, together with successive differences. The second table gives formulae for successive third entries of the column beginning with $ d $, together with successive differences. The third table gives formulae for succesive $ n $th entries of the column beginning with $ d $. The final table shows the $ n $th-entry formulae multiplied out, with differences calculated between them. This demonstrates that the constant difference, in a table constructed from every $ n $th entry of the original table, is $ nnna $. 14.) hoc est: that is: Blank page Following from the calculations in the previous folio (Add MS 6782 f. 121 ) for the column beginning with $ d $, this folio gives the formulae for successive $ n $th entries from the columns beginning with $ g $ and with $ f $. 15.) Blank page Following from the calculations in the previous folios (Add MS 6782 f. 122 ) for the columns beginning with $ f $ and $ g $, this folio gives the formulae for successive $ n $th entries from the columns beginning with $ d $, $ c $, and $ b $. 16.) Blank page This folio shows the formulae from page 15 (Add MS 6782 f. 122 ) for the $ g $ column, multiplied out in full and with differences calculated between all entries. The table is too wide to fit on the page, so the differences appear in the boxes below the main entries. 17.) Blank page This folio shows the formulae for the $ f $, $ d $, $ c $, and $ b $ columns from pages 15 and 16 (Add MS 6782 f. 122 and f. 123 ) multiplied out in full and with differences calculated between all entries. 18.) Blank page On this folio and the next (Add MS 6782 f. 126 and f. 127 ), Harriot has used the formulae from page 17 (Add MS 6782 f. 124 ) to write equations for $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, $ d $, $ f $, and $ g $ in terms of $ A $, $ B $, $ C $, $ D $, $ F $, and $ G $. He has solved first for $ a $ in terms of $ A $, then for $ b $ in terms of $ A $ and $ B $, then for $ c $ in terms of $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, and so on. He has ended each calculation with 'RE', indicating 'recto' or 'correct'. 19.) 1. Canon. $ g $. Canon for $ g $ Blank page This folios is the continuation of page 19 (Add MS 6782 f. 126 ). 20.)

The symbols $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $ in the upper tables indicate that these formulae may be used to interpolate values in tables of tangents and secants. The symbol $ \upsilon $ in the lower tables indicate that these formulae may be used to interpolate tables of sines. 23.) Canones, $ g $.

The symbol $ \upsilon $ in the lower tables indicate that these formulae may be used to interpolate tables of sines. 24.) Canones, $ f $. Canons for $ f $ Blank page On this folio, Harriot has summarized his results from page 22 (Add MS 6782 f. 129 ) and has extended them to other patterns of increasing and decreasing columns. The symbols $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $ in the upper tables indicate that these formulae may be used to interpolate tables of tangents and secants. The symbol $ \upsilon $ in the lower tables indicate that these formulae may be used to interpolate tables of sines. 25.) Canones, $ d $. Canons for $ d $ Canones, $ c $. Canons for $ c $ Blank page This folio contains a set of formulae for interpolating $ (n - 1) $ new terms between each pair of entries in the fourth column of a difference table (the $ D $ column). For reasons of space, Harriot has written the entries for the fourth column below those for the first, second, and third columns. At the bottom of the page, he has written a single general formula for the $ N $th interpolated term in the fourth column. This he calls the 'magisterium', which may here be translated as 'rule'. Since this formula is expressed entirely in terms of $ n $, $ N $, $ D $, $ C $, $ B $, and $ A $, he longer needs to compute $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $. 26.) Pro Magisterio $ d $. For the rule for $ d $ Magisterium. Rule Blank page This page shows formulae analogous to the 'magisterium' on page 26 (Add MS 6782 f. 133 ) for the interpolation of difference tables of up to six columns, with all columns increasing. The symbols $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $ indicate that these formulae may be used to interpolate tables of tangents and secants. The symbol $ \frac{N}{n} $ in this context is not a fraction, but indicates that the expression to the left of it is the $ N $th entry of a table interpolated to $ n $ times its original length. The sign )=( may therefore be read as 'indexed by'. On BL Add MS 6787 f. 352 , Harriot experiments with various alternatives for the symbol )=(. 27.)

The symbol $ \upsilon $ indicates that these formulae may be used to interpolate tables of sines. 30.) Magisteria Rules Blank page The numbers 4, 3, 2, and 1 in the upper righthand corners of pages 31, 32, 33, and 34, (Add MS 6782 f. 138 to f. 141 ) indicate that these four folios are closely related and could be read in either direction. This folio brings together the formulae from pages 27 to 30 (Add MS 6782 f. 134 to f. 137 ). The coefficients of $ A $, $ B $, $ C $, $ D $, $ F $, and $ G $ are now written as descending rather than ascending powers of $ N $. This means that the signs of the coefficients now follow the patterns given in the sign charts for all increasing, or all decreasing, or alternately increasing and decreasing columns. The symbols $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $ below the upper table indicate that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of tangents and secants. The symbol $ \upsilon $ below the lower table indicates that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of sines. 31.) (4. Blank page This folio contains the same interpolation formulae as on page 31, but now the coefficients of $ A $, $ B $, $ C $, and $ D $ have been factorized. The inclusion of columns headed $ h $ and $ H $ in the inset charts, on this and the two following pages (Add MS 6782 f. 140 and f. 141 ), emphasizes that the formulae may be generalized to any number of columns. The symbols $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $ below the lower left table indicate that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of tangents and secants. The symbol $ \upsilon $ below the lower right table indicates that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of sines. 32.) (3. Blank page This folio contains another version of the interpolation formulae on pages 31 and 32 (Add MS 6782 f. 138 and f. 139 ), but now each coefficient of $ A $, $ B $, $ C $, and $ D $ has its own denominator. This appears to be Harriot's preferred form. The symbols $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $ below the lower left table indicate that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of tangents and secants. The symbol $ \upsilon $ below the lower right table indicates that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of sines. 33.) (2. Blank page This folio contains the same formulae as page 33 (Add MS 6782 f, 140 ) but with $ \frac{N}{n} $ now replaced by $ N $. That is, there is no interpolation. This page is numbered 1 in its upper righthand corner, making it the first in the subsequence of pages 34, 33, 32, and 31 (Add MS 6782 f. 141 to f. 138 ). Harriot explained on the next page (Add MS 6782 f. 142 ), which is a second version of this one, also numbered 1 in its upper righthand corner, that one may begin with the formulae on page 34 (Add MS 6782 f. 141 ), then derive the formulae on page 33 (Add MS 6782 f. 140 ) by replacing $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $. That is, one can reverse the sequence of pages 31 to 34. As on pages 32 and 33 (Add MS 6782 f. 139 and f. 140 ) the sign charts show how to adapt the formulae to different patterns of increasing and decreasing columns. The symbols $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $ below the lower left table indicate that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of tangents and secants. The symbol $ \upsilon $ below the lower right table indicates that these patterns are required for interpolating tables of sines. 34.) (1. Blank page On this folio, Harriot explains the relationship between the formulae on pages 33 and 34 (Add MS 6782 f. 140 and f. 141 ), and their common origin in those that appeared earlier, on page 5 (Add MS 6782 f. 112 ). In the lower half of the page, just below the dividing line, Harriot replaces $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $ in formula 3) from page 34 , arriving at formula 3) from page 33 . In this case, he is using $ \frac{N}{n} $ to denote an ordinary fraction. 34.) 2o.) 1.) Etsi species quæ habentur (pag: 34.1.) ortum ducunt ex (pag: 33.2.) Attamen primam originem videre licet pag. 5. ubi illæ omnes appareat notatæ. Although the cases we have on page 34.1 arise from those on page 33.2, nevertheless one may see their origins on page 5 where all of them appear in notation. Utile etiam ac incundum est, considerare harum reductionum (vide versa) ad species in pag: 33.2. quæ huius operis sunt magisteria maxima. It is useful and also pleasing to consider (conversely) the reduction to the cases on page 33.2, which are the most important rules of this work. Examplum unum sufficiet. One example will suffice. Sit $ N = \frac{N}{n} $. Let $ N = \frac{N}{n} $ Et species reducta erit: (ut pag: 33.2.) et ut sequitur: And the cases will be reduced (as on page 33.2) and as follows: Fit ita: Si, $ N = \frac{N}{n} $ erit: Let it be done thus: then: Et sic de alijs speciebus. And so on for other cases. Blank page On this and the following folio (Add MS 6782 f. 144 ), Harriot gives numerical examples of his interpolation method. At the top of the page are formulae for $ \frac{N}{n} $ and for $ N $, for difference tables with two columns. Below that are four examples of tables with two columns. The table on the left, with columns headed $ N $, $ B $, $ A $, is interpolated first to six, then four, then five times the number of original entries; that is, $ n $ takes the values 6, then 4, then 5. The symbol * next to the interpolated tables marks entries from the original lefthand table. Below the tables, the first column of working uses the formula for $ N $ from the top of the page, to obtain the entries 17, 77, and 149 in the difference table on the left. The second column of working uses the formula for $ \frac{N}{n} $ from the top of the page, to obtain one entry in each of the three remaining difference tables. The third column of working presents the converse problem, showing how to solve for $ N $ (or $ \frac{N}{n} $ ), given values of $ A $ and $ B $ and an entry $ Z $. Where the solution is not an integer, Harriot replaces $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $. 35.) Blank page This folio gives further numerical examples of interpolation for tables with three columns. As on page 35 (Add MS 6782 f. 143 ), Harriot gives the appropriate $ \frac{N}{n} $ and $ N $ formulae at the top of the page. The formula in the first line is from page 33 (Add MS 6782 f. 140 ), while the formulae on the second line are from page 32 (Add MS 6782 f. 139 ). The difference table on the left (headed $ N $, $ C $, $ B $, $ A $) is interpolated to five times, and then twice, the number of original entries; that is $ n $ takes the values 5 and 2, respectively. The working in the first column illustrates the use of the formula for $ N $ to calculate values in the left hand table. The working in the second column illustrates the use of the formula for $ \frac{N}{n} $ to calculate the first new value in the second table (indexed $ \frac{1}{5} $), and the third new value in the third table (indexed $ \frac{3}{2} $). The working in the third column shows, as on page 35 (Add MS 6782 f. 143 ), how to find $ \frac{N}{n} $ given values of $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, and an entry $ Z $. In this case the working leads to a quadratic equation for $ N $, which Harriot solves by completing the square. As on page 35, the solution is not an integer, and so Harriot replaces $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $. 36.) Blank page This folios contains an interpolation formula from the 'Magisteria' but instead of $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, ... we now have $ e $, $ p^1 $, $ p^2 $, $ p^3 $, ... (these are superscripts, not powers). The notation $ P $, $ D^1 $, $ D^2 $, ... at the top of the page is unusual; the formula is otherwise identical to formula 5) from page 33. Blank page Interpolated tables, see page 35 of the 'Magisteria' (Add MS 6782 f. 143 ). This folio contains interpolation formulae similar to those on page 32 (Add MS 6782 f. 139 ). It also contains a title similar, but not identical, to that at the beginning of the 'Magisteria' (Add MS 6782 f. 107 ). THOMÆ HARIOTI Magisteria Numerorum Trangularium et inde Progressionum Arithmeticarum (veteribus et recentioribus ignota) incognita) THOMAS HARRIOT'S doctrine of triangular numbers and thence arithmetic progressions (unkonwn and unrecognized by ancient and more recent authors) The two lines at the end of the page have nothing to do with the mathematics above them, and are not apparently connected with each other. 'Porcus per taurum sequitur vestigia ferri' is the first line of an epitaph engraved on the tombstone of Edmund Bunny, rector of Bolton Percy and canon of York, who died in February 1617/8 and was interred in York Minster: Porcus per taurum sequitur vestigia ferri  Anser ovem maculat, cui potum vacca ministrat. Expone et redde sensum This is an illustration of synecdoche, in which a part is referred to as the whole; thus the pig (lard, here as used to lubricate cobbler's thread) follows the footprints of the iron (needle) through the bull (leather); the goose (quill), to whom the cow (inkhorn) provides drink (ink), stains the sheep (skin). (The standard version has variat instead of maculat.) Expone et redde sensum is an instruction to the student: 'explain and translate'. It is possible that porcus is a play on Percy. If the York epitaph was Harriot's source, it gives us a possible date of 1618 for this folio. 'Bombardagladiofunhastiflammiloquentes' (Breathing bombs, swords, death, spears, and flames) is from a Latin translation by the 16th-century German humanist Martin Crucius of a Greek verse (perhaps also by Crucius) consisting of compound words. The verse appears in the preface to the Opera omnnia theologica (1583) of Lambert Daneau and in the third edition of his Elenchi hæreticorum (1592). The same line appears also in Add MS 6788 f. 50 .

Rough work Rules for the numbers in six successive columns, generated from a constant difference $ p $ in column 0. The first entry in each column is also $ p $. The expression in the first box, $ pn $, gives the $ n $th entry in the first column ($ p $, $ 2p $, $ 3p $, $ 4p $, and so on). The expression in the second box, $ pnn + 1pn $, divided by 2, gives the $ n $th entry in the second column ($ p $, $ 3p $, $ 6p $, $ 10p $, and so on). The expression in the third box, $ pnnn + 3pnn + 2pn $, divided by 6, gives the $ n $th entry in the third column ($ p $, $ 4p $, $ 10p $, $ 20p $, and so on).

The numbers beneath the sketch are those needed to construct triangular prisms with length equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 6 = 2 \times 3 $, $ 18 = 3 \times 6 $, and so on. These are also the pentagonal-pyramidal numbers 1, 6, 18, ... as calculated in Add MS 6782 f. 156 . Successive sums of these numbers are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. In the upper right table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a cube. The numbers beneath the sketch are the cube numbers, which can also be thought of (in keeping with the previous table) as the numbers needed to construct square prisms with height equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 8 = 2 \times 4 $, $ 27 = 3 \times 9 $, and so on. Successive sums are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. The column beginning 1, 7, 19, 37, ... is marked 'hexagonae equianguli’ (equiangled hexagons); it is possible that at first glance Harriot mistook this column for the the hexagonal-pyramidal numbers 1, 7, 22, 50, .... In the lower left table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a pentagonal prism. The numbers beneath the sketch are the numbers needed to construct pentagonal prisms with length equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 10 = 2 \times 5 $, $ 36 = 3 \times 12 $, and so on. Successive sums are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. In the lower right table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a hexagonal prism. The numbers beneath the sketch are the numbers needed to construct hexagonal prisms with length equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 12 = 2 \times 6 $, $ 45 = 3 \times 15 $, and so on. Successive sums are shown in the column headed to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. The formulae at the bottom of the page are for sums of triangular, square, pentagonal, and hexagonal prisms. Thus the sum of the first two triangular prisms is shown in the upper left table as 1 + 6 = 7. The same number may be calculated from the formula $ \frac{3aaaa + 10aaa + 9aa + 2a}{24} $ by putting $ a = 2 $.

Tables of figures, contents unidentified Blank page This folio shows all combinations of 0, $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, $ d $, $ e $, including in each case the null combination consisting only of 0. As on Add MS 6782 f. 35 , each set of combinations is constructed from the previous one by adding the new letter to the end of each existing combination. This shows clearly why the number of combinations doubles with each new letter. Blank page Combinations of two or more quantities, generated by multiplication. The letters $ p $, $ m $, $ f $, $ s $, stand for pondus (weight), magnitudo (magnitude), figura (area), situs (place) (see Add MS 6786 f. 291 ). Blank page This folio lists all the permutations of $ a $,$ ab $, $ abc $, $ abcd $, and begins lists for $ abcde $, $ abcdef $. The totals are written as factorials, that is, $ 2 = 1 \times 2 $, $ 6 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 $, and so on. This enables Harriot to calculate the number of permutations of 4 or 5 letters as 120 or 720, respectively, without writing out the entire list.

Rough work on combinations Tables showing all possible throws of 1, 2, or 3 dice. Blank page This folio is a summary of Harriot's calculations on dice. The tables on the left, after the page has been turned sideways, are frequency tables for the possible sums that can be obtained by throwing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dice (see Add MS 6782 f. 41 and f. 40v ). The totals in each case are the appropriate powers of 6. The tables on the right are summaries of the tables that appear on Add MS 6782 f. 50 , and indicate the number of ways repetitions can occur. Amongst the calculations at the bottom right are: (i) a table that appears to convert hours to £, at £30 per hour. (ii) a conversion of 46,656 shillings (one for each possibility for throws of six dice) into £ and shillings. Table (i) is based on £30 or 600 shillings per hour; converting shillings to throws of the dice, as suggested by table (ii), gives 600 throws per hour, or 10 throws per minute. (iii) the ratio of throws with repetitions to throws with no repetition, for six dice, namely (see the table above), $ 45,936 : 720 = 63\frac{576}{720} : 1 $.

Ut alijs chartis sequentibus apparebit. It is to be noted that any of these irrationals squared produces a trinomial composed of a binome and a medial. And any binome of this form in letters contains in itself two subforms. Which if in each case are set out, from these five irrationals there arise 10. As will appear in the following sheets. Blank page In modern notation, binomes are numbers of the form $ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ where $ m $ and $ n $ are integers. In Book X; Definitions II , Euclid defined six kinds of binomes, according to various relationships of $ m $ to $ n $, which for Euclid were geometric lengths. In modern notation, the six binomes may be defined as follows. Binome 1: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ 7 + \sqrt{48} $. Binome 2: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{12} + 3 $. Binome 3: a binome of the form$ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{8} + \sqrt{6} $. Binome 4: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ 2 + \sqrt{2} $. Binome 5: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{2} + 1 $. Binome 6: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2} $. Harriot made two further distinctions for binomes of the fifth and sixth kind according to whether $ k $ is itself a square (type i) or not (type (ii). In this and the following folio, Add MS 6782 f. 268 , Harriot shows that the square of any binome is always a binome of the first kind. This folio shows his working for first, second, and third binomes. Binomiorum quadrata, sunt binomia prima. Squares of binomes are binomes of the first kind. 1. bin) A binomial of the first kind. 2.) 3.) ut supra. as above. Blank page This folio is the continuation of Add MS 6782 f. 267 .

Thus, in calculating the cube, for wich the coefficients are 1, 3, 3, 1, the cube of 6 (the relevant digit of 60) is used once, the square is taken 3 times and multiplied by 7, while 6 is also taken 3 times and multiplied by the square of 7; finally the cube of 7 is added once.

The lower third of the page contain calculations of powers of 67 (see also Add MS 6782 f. 278 ). In the middle of the page, the binomial coefficients are listed in three different layouts. The table on the left shows how each row may be calculated by adding two copies of the previous row. A similar table appears again in the lower right of the page. The first units mentioned are bushels, a measure of grain, equivalent to 4 pecks or 8 gallons. The page contains a conversion of 6553600000 bushels per square mile to 10485760 bushels per acre (1 square mile = 640 acres), and a conversion of 262144 acres to 409 square miles. 10485,760 bushelles 262,144 acres 640 acres in a square mile 409 miles square 20 miles $ \frac{4}{5} $ Here Harriot calculates the square root of 4489, the cube root of 300763, the fourth root of 20151121, and the sixth root of 1350125107, demonstrating that the answer is 67 in each case.

In each case he writes down the values of $ a $ that reduce the resulting product to zero. For the second multiplication, for instance, he shows that the product becomes zero when $ a = b $ and $ a = c $ but not when $ a = d $.

Harriot calls this form of the cubic equation an 'elliptic' or 'Bombellian' equation. The special case where $ b = c $ he calls 'parabolic'. For Harriot's definitions of the hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic forms of a cubic equation without a square term, see Add MS 6783 f. 106 (e.8).

The definitions may be paraphrased as follows: Things are said to be together if they are in one place, apart if they are in different places. Things are said to be in contact if their extremities are together. Things are said to be continuous if the touching limits of each become one and the same. De infinitis. De continuo. On infinity. On the continuum. Aristotle in the beginning of his 6th booke of his physicks, & in the 26th treatise of the 5th booke, defineth those thinges to be continua quorum extrema sunt unum. And in the 22nd treatise of the said 5th booke that: tangentia sunt, quorum extrema sunt simul. Simul qua in uno loco sunt primo. Separatim qui sunt in altero. Now for the understanding better explication of the meaning of the definitions as also of their truth. Let us understand first two materiall cubes A & B to be separate, that is, to be in diverse planes, extremes & all. Blank page De Infinitis progressionibus On infinite progressions In progressions that be infinite be they increasing or decreasing. There are these passes. First to a quantity that haveth no proportion rate to the first quantity given, or rather because betwixt positive quantityes there is a positive rate, I may call that rate infinite either in great- ness or litleness according to the proportion progression, in respect of the first quantity given. Yet in respecte of the progression following it is divisible or mul- tiplicable till the progression being infinite hath for his second passe also a quantity of an infinite rate. Which is not only infinite in respecte of the first quantity of the last progression; but infinitely infinite in respect of of the first in the first progresse. And also the summe of the second pro- gression is infinite infi in respect of the first summe of the first pro- gression, or the first quantity of all. And so a third, fourth & infinite other progressions and passes; of which any quantity or the summe of all infinitely all, is of an infinite quantity in greatness of litleness in respect, of the summe or first quantity of the first progression. And yet at for a last in decreasing progressions we must needes under- stand a quantity absolutely indivisible; but multiplicable infinitely infinite to make the prime from where the rest are issued till a quantity absolutely immultiplicable be produced which I may call universally infinite. And in increasing progressions we must needes understand that at for a last there must be a quantity immultiplicable absolute, but divisible infinitely infinite till that quantity be issued that is absolutely indivisble. That such a quantity which I call universally infinite: hath not only act rationall, by supposition, or by consequence from mere supposition: but also act reall, or existence: in an instant, having perfect actuall being, or in time, passed by motion fini both finite & infinite: with many reall consequences or properties consequent; & accidents adioyning: shalbe declared in the papers following. Blank page De Infinitis. On infinity Seing that any finite line will subtend an angle at summe distance; as let $ bc $ subtend the the angle $ bac $. Then a line double to $ bc $, which let be $ de $, will subtend the same angle at a double distance, so that $ ab $ $ bd $ will be aequall to $ ab $. In those subtensions I understand that the poynt $ a $ be in a perpendicular line to the middle of the subtendent lines. as also in all the others which follow. Now I suppose $ bc $ to be removed to a further distance from the poynt $ a $. Then the angle $ bac $ subtended must be lesse than before. And $ de $. shall subtend the same angle at a double distance as before. And this is true generally continually that the further $ bc $ is removed the lesse angle it subtendeth & $ de $ always must subtend the same angle at a double distance. Then I suppose $ bc $ to be removed to an infinite distance; at which distance the supposition altereth not the quantity of $ bc $. but the quantity consequence is of the angle. Which wilbe, that the angle wh then subtended to be of an infinite quantity in litleness in respecte of the former angles. Yet it cannot be sayd to be no angle negatively because it is positive. & it must also follow that the line $ de $ must subtend the same positive angle at a double distance. Which is Double to the former infinite distance. Also, let the distance of the subtendents be nearer to infinite, it cannot be otherwise inferred but that the lines $ af $ & $ ag $ being infinit though infinite, be ad diversas partes, & in diversis locis, because $ bc $ & $ de $ are betweene them, & have agreement or concurrence but only in the poynt $ a $, or in no distance out of the poynt $ a $. And yet the nearness of there congruence & concurrence in all other partes at the utmost is such, that although they be remote; the angle is of no proportion explicable by nomber finite, but infinite unknown, to any angles other angle which we call finite. The like inexplicable proportion is of the subtendent lines $ de $ & $ bc $, to there infinite distance position from $ a $. And yet the sayd lines $ de $ & $ bc $. as also that infinite litle or improportio- nable angle is divisible still in infinitum. & still, although improportionable yet in an other respect, that is to say of his owne partes, is proportionable. Blank page De Infinitis. On infinity That in a finite time an infinite space may be moved It is now convenient that $ cf $ be in this line. Suppose the the line $ cef $ et ultra to be infinite, & the line $ ab $ suppose to revolve & describe a circle in a finite time, fro $ b $ towards $ g $. $ ab $ doth first respect $ c $, then $ d $, after $ e $, & so forth successively no poynt in the infinite line is not unrespected by that time the line $ ab $ cometh to $ ag $ where then the line is parallel & cutteth not the former line infinite. Now seing that a motion may be of any thing according to the continuall succession of a poynt, as well in respect of mobile ab motus. Whatsoever may be or not be in respect of the moment, it maketh no matter: the purpose is manifest. Consequentia Accidentis quædam huius motus. The line $ ab $ having moved till he comes to be $ ah $ that is parallel to $ cf $. & so that continuing his motion of revolution: The lines are parallel but in one instant. They never cut at an infinite distance but at that instant they are parallel. And if they cut then, they must cut ad utrasque partes & then being right lines there must be no space betwixte them, but there distance by supposition is more than the line $ ab $. Which implies contradiction. And yet there must be a cutting at an infinite distance or else all the poyntes of the infinite line could not have been respected. & if that be not some part of the infinite line, that is some quantity which it is finite is only cut; & that is at a finite distance; & then it maketh an angle of quantity at the greatest distance of such cutting: from that cutting the line by motion came to be parallel: That motion is made in an instant or in time. If in time, then in half the time the cutting must be further than the supposed furthest; If in an instant, our line wilbe in two places two places in one instant; quæ implicant. The lines therefore must cut at an infinite distance before they come to be parallel. And that must be in time before or in an instant before. If in time, then in half the time they cut at greater distance than infinite or are parallel before they are parallel. Which both do imply contradiction. If in an instant before; the two instants are one or different. If one, implicat. If two there must be no other betwixt them. And then there be a time greater than an instant & lesse than any time of quantity that is indivisible, that is agayne, indivisible into partes of quantity. & so also like of poyntes &c. Blank page De Infinitis. On infinity If the The line $ ab $ by his revolution cometh at length to be parallel to the infinite line $ bf $. Which motion being from $ b $ to $ g $ suppose to have been æqually. The degree of the motion let be $ mn $. the time $ op $. The beginning of the time or first instant $ o $. The last instant wherein the line is parallel, $ p $. Now seing that $ ab $ must cut at an infinite distance & that his last cutting must be before the instant $ p $. Which suppose $ q $. That $ q $ as it is argued by the premises must differe from $ p $ by an indivisible time, so that it $ q $ must be the next instant to $ p $. & no other between. In which instant $ q $, $ ab $ must not be parallel but make his last cutting at an infinite distance. And therefore it must have a certayne situs at that instant out of the point $ g $ towards $ b $, which let be $ af $, as it maketh his last section. In which situation the motion ordering it hath the sayd degree $ mn $, as in all other situations. From the which situation to the situation of being parallel it must be moved unto (as it is sayd) in the next instant. Now suppose (as it may be) that the motion from $ b $ to $ g $ be in half the time of $ op $. Then doth it follow necessarily that the degree of motion or velo- city be double to $ mn $. And therefore, what space or parte of a space, (be it finite or infinite, so it be positive,) it moved before according to the degree of $ mn $. it moveth the same now, in half the time. Therefore in this second motion when $ ab $ cometh to have his situation at $ af $ to make the sayd last section; seing that then it hath double degree of velocity; it must afterward be parallel in half an instant that is to say, that in half that time which was sayd to be indivisible. Which doth imply contradiction. Agayne if it be sayd that $ af $ at that instant & in the position (when & where it maketh his last section with $ bf $ before it be parallel) then be deinceps to $ ah $. or that the poynts $ f $ & $ h $ be deinceps at an infinite distance so that no point can be between. Yet from the poynt $ k $ to $ f $ may be interposed a line $ kf $. and also from $ l $ to $ f $. & by the doctrine of Elements the angle $ fkh $, or $ flh $ must be greater lesser than $ fah $. & therefore lesse than that which was sayd to be least or indivisible. & therefore the lines $ af $ & $ ah $, or the poynts $ f $ & $ h $ be not deinceps. quæ implicant.

The ratio of Achilles There is a reason of Zeno in Aristotle (in the 6th booke of his phisickes. text. 78.) which for the sorce it seemeth to carry is called Achilles. And for that cause, no doubt, is the name also Achilles used in the example to expresse the reason. The which because it is against Aristotles doctrine & for that it compryseth matter pregnant of greater consequence concerning the doctrine of infinites, it being there but briefly & obscurely set downe with an answere uncertayne: I thinke good to set downe more & largely: with Aristotles Answere as he hath it in the place allwayes, as also at full according to his owne doctrine in other places. To the end that comparing one with the other, the truth may appear, & perhaps seem otherwise to be, then yet hath been by the peripateticles either noted or observed. The proposition of Zeno is. The swift runner (runne he never so swiftly) shall never overtake the slow runner mover (runne move he never so slowly. That there may be no doubte of the meaning of the proposition we will declare what thinges are therein supposed. The suppositions for the reason are adjoyned. ffirst, (as it ought to be, else the proposition were ridiculous) The motion of the runner & slow mover are understood to be both one way & in one right line. Secondly the of must be of some The Blank page Ratio Achilles. The ratio of Achilles Let Achilles be $ A $. Testudo $ B $. The tortoise $ B $.

And therefore the time wherein that $ A $ hath moved to $ d $ must be the same wherein $ B $ hath moved to $ d $. But the space $ Ad $ to $ Bd $ must be as 10 to 1. Now by the supposition it must follow (because these motions be proportionall (as 10 to 1)) * As $ AB $ to $ BC $. so: $ Ad $ to $ Bd $. which same termes proportionall call by these same letters & in the same order. As $ \beta $ is known to be 1. $ \gamma $ is $ \frac{1}{10} $. $ \beta + \alpha $ is unknown. & so is $ \alpha $. yet this is known that. is æquall to $ \varepsilon $. * Now what other proportion is this than if a man should say as all the first to the second so all the antecedents to all the consequents which in this be infinite in nomber. X To find that poynt geometrically is set downe in my other papers de infinitis. on infinity Blank page De Infinitis. On infinity Now will I propound some dfficultyes to be considered of. Seing that every line is compounded of atomes, & therefore the periphery of a circle. that is to say one atomus is succeeding one an other infinitely in such manner as that the perifery is at last compounded and made. Now also seing that the whole periferies is compounded of atomis undiquaque sitis about the poynt $ a $. so many times infinitely, & to that number of them infinitely, till the circle supposed be accomplished. I demand therefore then what wilbe the nomber of atomi that are deinceps about the point $ a $. Infinite they must needes be, or else infinite lines could not be dra supposed actually from the point $ a $ to the perifery. And infinite also are also in the perifery. But now I demande whether they are aequally infinite or not. If about the center are lesse infinite then there cannot from the center $ a $ to every poynt in the perifery be understood a right line but we must understand those atomi about the center that we supposed indivisible, divisble which were absurd. and if they be æqually infinite: then the same nomber of atomi in a great place, (where the nomber, although infinite, yet in them selves definite; because they being supposed to have acte there is not one more nor lesse. Neither can there be more because they being deinceps one more cannot be between there being no distance: & if there be supposed might be one lesse; there lacketh of the supposed actaull, & definite & positive number although infinite. Then I say in a greate place where there could be no more or lesse, in a lesse place there are an æquall nomber; which seemeth to imply. An other difficulty riseth from the square. If a line be compounded of atomis, the diametrall line wilbe found to be aæquall to the side. ffor suppose the line $ ab $ to be drawne from the poynt from the point $ a $ of the line $ ad $, to the point $ b $, of th the line $ bc $. Then from the next point $ e $, which is deinceps to $ a $ in the line $ ad $, draw a line to $ f $ the next point to $ b $ in the line $ bc $. So likewise from every next point in the line $ ad $, to every next point in the line $ bc $. Now the lines so drawne must needs be the least & most that may be, because they are deinceps & all. & they all cut the line $ ac $ & of the line $ ac $ there can be between no point betwixt the two of the former lines because they are deinceps. And therefore the nomber of the poynts of the line $ ac $, are aequally infinite to the poynts of $ ab $ & per consequence the lines $ ab $ & $ ac $ aequall. But this difficulty wilbe made more playne by the next following, which wilbe found the meanes for the solution of all. An other question is. where two atomi are deinceps. whether an other (the other first two not disioyned) may either passe or have situation betwixt them. Blank page De Infinitis. Notanda.

Such equations have one, and only one, positive root. The work is closely based on Problems 1 to 6 of Viète's De numerosa potestatum ad exegesin resolutione (Viete 1600b) ; Harriot's heading 'De numerosa potestatum resolutione' directly echoes Viète's. The method works by finding each digit of the root in turn. Suppose that a required root $ a $ of is of the form $ b + c $, where $ b $ represents multiples of 10 and $ c $ represents units. The first digit is found by inspection. The canonical form then shows how to estimate $ c $. In the problem on this page, for example, Harriot first takes $ b $ to be 40, but quickly finds that this is too large. Therefore $ b $ must be 30. Subtracting the known values of $ bb $ (= 900) and $ bd $ (= 720) from 2356 leaves him with 736, which according to the canonical form must correspond to $ 2bc + cd + cc $. A first estimate for $ c $ is found by dividing 736 by $ 2b + d $ (= 84). The integer part of the quotient is 8. In fact $ c = 8 $ satisfies the equation $ 2bc + cd + cc = 736 $ exactly and so the process is complete. Later examples become more complicated but follow the same basic procedure.

Viète gave rules for the relationship between the two roots but did not explain how he had arrived at them. This page demonstrates clearly two kinds of canonical forms used by Harriot in this treatise. The first, the 'canonical form for unequal roots' is the general form of an avulsed cubic without a linear term; in this case $ b $ and $ c $ are the two positive roots of the equation. The second, the 'canonical form for the solution' is the form arrived at by assuming the root $ a $ takes the form $ 10b + c $, that is, $ b $ is the first integer in the solution, $ c $ the second. Thus the meanings of $ b $ and $ c $ in the two forms are quite different. c.10.) De numerosa potestatum resolutione.

Blank page This is the first of a set of 18 pages on extracting roots of avulsed equations, that is, equations containing three terms, in which the term of highest degree is subtracted (torn away, or 'avulsed') from the term of next higest degree. Such equations have two positive roots. It is therefore important to know the relative sizes of the roots before beginning extraction by numerical methods. This is the problem Harriot investigated in this section. The work is closely based on Problems 16 to 20 in Viète, De numerosa potestatum ad exegesin resolutione, (Viete 1600b) .

In the 1646 edition of Viète's Opera mathematica the six propositions are to be found on page 413 . On this folio Harriot examines Proposition I, part 2. I. Data peripheria composita e duabus peripheriis, quarum transsinuosae datam habeant rationem, dantur singulæ. 2 Et si composita major est quadrante circuli, utraque vero componentium minor quadrante, Erit, Vt transsinuosa primæ ad transsinuousa secundæ, ita transsinuosa complementi composita ad prosinum secunda minus prosinus complementa compositæ. I.Given an arc composed of two others, whose secants are in a given ratio, each is known individually. 2. And if the sum is greater than a quarter of a circle, but each component is less than a quarter, then as the secant of the first is to the secant of the second, so is the secant of the complement of the sum to the tangent of the second minus the tangent of the complement of the sum.

I.Given an arc composed of two others, whose secants are in a given ratio, each is known individually. 3. And if further the first arc is less than a quadrant, the second greater, then as the secant of the first is to the secant of the second, so is the secant of the complement of the sum to the sine of the complement of the sum minus the sine of the second, and [4.] as the secant of the second to the secant of the first, so is the secant of the complement of the sum to the sine of the complement of the sum plus the sine of the second.

Triangles $ hed $ and $ efm $ are equiangular, for $ ehd $ is the complement of angle $ beh $, thence equal to angle $ bek $, to which $ fem $ is equal by construction; therefore $ fem $ and $ ehd $ are equal, and angles $ hed $ et $ efm $ are equal because $ kf $ and $ eh $ are parallel.

He also refers to Euclid's Elements, Book III, Proposition 16. III.16 The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle, and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle of the semicircle is greater, and the remaining angle less, than any acute rectilineal angle. Si angulus semicirculi sit minor recto rectilineo: dabitur angulus rectilineus maior angulo semicirculi et minor recto rectilineo. Contra Eculidem lib. 3. prop. 16. If the angle in a semicircle is less than a right angle, there may be found an angle greater than the angle in the semicircle and less than a right angle. Against Euclid III.16. Si angulus rectus et maior angulo semicirculi. $ G $. Differentia inter angulum rectum et angulum semicurculi. $ Z $. Ergo angulus semicirculi. $ G - Z $. Et sit aliquis angulus rectilineus maior quam $ G $. $ = H $ Suppose a right angle is greater than the angle in a semicircle, $ G $. The difference between the right angle and the angle in the semicircle is $ Z $. Therefore the angle in the semicircle is $ G - Z $. And let $ H $ be any angle greater than $ G $. Tum ut $ H $ ad $ G $ ita $ H - Z $ ad $ A $. aliquem rectilineum angulum ... qui minor est quam $ G $ et maior quam $ G - Z $. Then as $ H $ is to $ G $ so $ H - Z $ is to $ A $, another angle which is less than $ G $ and greater than $ G - Z $.

Ergo $ A $ est Maior quam $ G - Z $ et minor quam $ G $. Now subtracting $ H - Z $ from $ H $ there remains $ Z $; and $ A $ from $ G $, there remains $ G - A $. Therefore $ H : G = Z : G - A $, therefore $ A $ is less than $ G $. And $ H : G = Z : F $ less than $ Z $. Therefore, subtracting, $ H : G = H - Z : G - F $ Therefore, combining this proportion with the first, $ G - F = A $. And since $ F $ is less than $ Z $, therefore $ G - F $ is greater than $ G - Z $. Therefore $ A $ is greater than $ G - Z $ and less than $ G $.

Further, let $ e $ be the portion of the second line. * Nota. Hinc facile apparet quod minores unciæ non possunt exigi à primo latere cum sit minus. Atque ideo non datur quartus casus. * Note. Here is is easily seen that smaller fractions cannot be taken from the first line since it is smaller. And therefore therefore no fourth case is given.

Zeteticum VII Datum latus ita secare, ut praefinitae unciae unius segmenti, adjunctae praefinitis unciis alterius: aequent summam praescriptam. To cut a given line in such a way that a fixed part of one segment, added to a fixed part of the other, is equal to a prescribed sum. Viète used the letter $ B $ for the whole line, $ D $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the first part to the first segment, and $ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second segment, $ H $ for the prescribed sum, and $ A $ and $ E $ for the unknown parts of the first and second segments. Harriot followed Viète's method on Add MS 6782 f. 458 . Here he works the same problem using numbers instead of lengths. Zet. lib. 1. Zet. 7.

To divide a given number into two parts, so that $ \frac{1}{4} $ of one, the first part, added to $ \frac{1}{6} $ of the second equals a prescribed sum; the prescribed sum must be less than $ \frac{1}{4} $ of the given number and greater than $ \frac{1}{6} $. $ b $. sit numerus datus. 60 $ d $. igitur 15. $ f $ erit 10. $ h $ summa præscribenda debet esse maior quam $ f $, et minor quam $ d $. sit ergo 12. Let $ b $ be the given number, 60. Therefore $ d $ is 15 and $ f $ will be 10. The prescribed sum $ h $ must be grater than $ f $ and less than $ d $, therefore let it be 12. $ o $. prima pars. $ a $. $ \frac{1}{4} $ primæ partis. Let $ o $ be the first part, $ a $ a $ \frac{1}{4} $ of the first part. $ u $. secunda pars. $ e $: eius $ \frac{1}{6} $ Let $ u $ be the second part, $ e $ a $ \frac{1}{6} $ of it. hac analogia ita solvitur problema. Ergo. 36. erit secunda pars. 6. erit eius $ \frac{1}{6} $. 6. est $ \frac{1}{4} primæ $ quæ æquat 12. The problem is thus solved by this ratio. Therefore 36 will be the second part. 6 is $ \frac{1}{6} $ of it, 6 is $ \frac{1}{4} $ of the first part which makes 12. aliter. Ergo. 24. erit prima pars. 6. eius $ \frac{1}{4} $. 6. est $ \frac{1}{6} secundæ $ Another way Therefore 24 will be the first part. 6 is $ \frac{1}{4} $ of it, 6 is $ \frac{1}{6} $ of the second part Aliud exemplum Another example Rough work This is the first of several pages in which Harriot worked on Zetetica 7 to 10 from Book I of Viète's Zeteticorum libri quinque (Viète 1593, Zet I.7 to I.10) . Harriot at first treated the problems exactly as Viète had done, using the geometric language in which the word latus represents an unknown line, side, or root. However, in each case Harriot then switched from geometry to arithmetic, treating the known and unknown quantities as numbers rather than geometrical quantities. This page contains Harriot's working of Zetetic 7. Zeteticum VII Datum latus ita secare, ut præfinitæ unciæ unius segmenti, adjunctae præfinitis unciis alterius: æquent summam præscriptam. To cut a given line in such a way that a fixed part of one segment, added to a fixed part of the other, is equal to a prescribed sum. Viète used the letter $ B $ for the whole line, $ D $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the first part to the first segment, $ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second segment, $ H $ for the prescribed sum, and $ A $ and $ E $ for the parts of the first and second segments. Harriot repeated Viète's working in his own notation, and also added some variants of his own. The numbers at the bottom of the page are taken from Viète. On Add MS 6782 f. 457 , Harriot worked the same problem with further numerical examples. Lib. 1. Zetet. Zet. 7.

Quæretur iam: $ o $, et, $ u $, segmenta et segmentorum portiones. Let the given line be $ b $, and the two segments $ o $ and $ u $. The portion of the first segment is $ a $; as $ d $ is to $ b $, so must be $ a $ to $ o $. The prescribed sum is $ h $. Therefore the portion of the second segment will be $ h - a $. As $ f $ is to $ b $, so must be % h - a $ to $ u $. There are now sought $ o $ and $ u $, the segments, and the portions of the segments. $ h $ minor $ d $ et maior $ f $. $ h $ is less than $ d $ and greater then $ f $. Aliter. Sit portio secundæ segmenti, $ e $ Ergo portio primæ segmenti $ h - e $. Another way. Let the portion of the second segment be $ e $. Therefore the portion of the first segment is $ h - e $. Dantur etiam $ o $, et $ u $, per superiores analogias. $ o $ and $ u $ are also given by the above ratios. Additio nostra. Aliter. An addition of my own. Another way. Aliter. Another way. Nota.

To find two lines, whose difference is prescribed, and also such that a fixed part of the first taken from a fixed part of the second is likewise equal to a given difference. Viète used the letter $ B $ for the difference between the two lines, $ D $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the first part to the first line, $ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second line, $ H $ for the gvien difference, and $ A $ and $ E $ for the parts of the first and second lines.

To find two lines, whose difference is prescribed, and also such that a fixed part of one line added to a fixed part of the other is equal to a prescibed sum. Viète used the letter $ B $ for the difference between the two lines, $ D $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the first part to the first line, $ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second line, $ H $ for the prescribed sum, and $ A $ and $ E $ for the parts of the first and second lines.

Secundo casu primum segmentum intelligitur minus. Ergo secundi segmenti erit maius. $ e $ portio secundi lateris. ergo: $ h - e $ portio primi lateris, et minoris. In the second case the first line is understood to be smaller. Therefore the second line will be greater. Let $ e $ be the portion of the second line. Therefore $ h - e $ is the portion of the first line, and smaller. Porro, sit $ a $, portio primi lateris minoris. Further, let $ a $ be the portion of the first, smaller line. Additio nostra pro secundus casus aliter. $ a $, portio primi lateris et minoris Ergo $ h - a $ portio secundi lateris, et maioris.

Given two roots, one less than the correct root, the other exceeding it, together with the ratio of the defect to the excess, find the correct root.

Let $ b $ be the deficiency from the correct root, $ d $ the excess over the correct root, and $ r $ to $ s $ the ratio of the defect to the excess. First, let $ a $ be the defect from the correct side. Therefore $ b + a $ is the correct root. Then $ r : s = a : \frac{sa}{r} $, the excess. Therefore 80 is the correct root. Secundo $ e $. esto excessus. Ergo: $ d - e $. latus iustum. Tum: $ s , r : e , \frac{re}{s} $. defectus. Ergo 80 latus iustum. Second. Let $ e $ be the excess. Therefore $ d - e $ is the correct root. Then $ s : r = e : \frac{re}{s} $, the defect. Therefore 80 is the correct root. Aliter Another way. $ a $. esto latus iustum.

First, let $ a $ be the first excess. Therefore $ b - a $ is the correct root. Then $ r : s = a : \frac{sa}{r} $, the second excess. Therefore the correct root is 20. Secundo $ e $. esto excessus secundi. Ergo: $ d - e $. latus iustum. Tum: $ s , r : e , \frac{re}{s} $. excessus primi. Ergo latus iustum 30. Second. Let $ e $ be the second excess. Therefore $ d - e $ is the correct root. Then $ s : r = e : \frac{re}{s} $, the first excess. Therefore the correct root is 30. Aliter Another way. $ a $. esto latus iustum. Ergo $ b - a $. excessus primi. $ d - a $. excessus secundi. Let $ a $ be the correct root. Therefore $ b - a $ is the first excess, $ d - a $ the second excess. 20. $ a $. latus iustum $ a = 20 $, the correct root. Nota. Si notatio ita fiat. sit $ b $. latus minus $ d $. latus maius &c.

Zeteticum IV Datis duobus lateribus deficientibus à justo, una cum ratione defectum: invenire latus justum. Given two roots less than the correct one, and the ratio of the defects, find the correct root. Viète used the letters $ B $ and $ D $ for the two roots, and $ R $ to $ S $ for the ratio of the defects. Harriot repeated Viète's working, including his alternative method ('Aliter'),in his own notation. The symbol that looks like a modern = sign is to be read as a minus sign, used by Harriot (following Viète) in cases where it was not known which quantity was greater. Thus, $ a = b $ is to be read as '$ a - b $ or $ b - a $, whichever is positive'. In modern notation the same result is represented by $ |a - b| $. Zetet. lib. 1. Zet. 4.

Ergo: $ b + a $. latus iustum. Tum: $ r , s : a , \frac{sa}{r} $ defect. 2i Ergo latus iustum: 60. First. Let $ b $ be the first root, $ d $ the second, $ r $ to $ s $ the ratio of the first defect to the second, $ a $ the first defect. Therefore $ b + a $ is the true root. Then $ r : s = a : \frac{sa}{r} $, the second defect. Therefore the correct root is 60. secundo $ e $. esto defectus secundi. Ergo: $ d + e $. latus iustum. Tum: $ s , r : e , \frac{re}{s} $. Ergo latus iustum: 60. Second Let $ e $ be the second defect. Therefore the true root is $ d + e $. Then $ s : r = e : \frac{re}{s} $. Therefore the correct root is 60. Aliter Another way. $ a $. esto latus iustum. Ergo $ a - b $. defectus primi. $ a - d $. defectus secundi. Quære: $ a - b , a - d : r , s $. Ergo: $ ra - rd = sa - sb $ Hoc est: $ sb == rd = sa == ra $. Ergo: $ \frac{sb == rd}{s == r} = a $ Let $ a $ be the correct root. Therefore $ a - b $ is the first defect, $ a - d $ the second. Obtain: $ a - b : a - d = r : s $. Therefore: $ |ra - rd| = |sa - sb| $. That is: $ \frac{|sb - rd|}{|s - r|} = a $. Emendata Vieta si $ b $ sit minor quam $ d $. vel $ s $, minor quam $ r $. $ ra - rd = sa - sb $. Tum si $ d $ sit maior quam $ b $: vel $ r $ maior quam $ s $. Inde: $ ra - sa = rd - sb $ Vel: $ re + se = sg $. Unde: $ a = \frac{rd - sb}{r - s} $ A correction to Viète. If $ b $ is smaller than $ d $, or $ s $ is smaller than $ r $, then $ ra - rd - sa - sb $. Then if $ d $ is greater than $ b $, or $ r $ is greater than $ a $, thence $ ra - sa - rd - sb $ or $ re + se = sg $. Whence $ a = \frac{rd - sb}{r - s} $.

To find two similar right-angled triangles having given hypotenuses, and subtracting the base of a third triangle, composed of the perpendicular of the first and the base of the second, will give a predefined quantity. The predefined base, moreover, must be greater than the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Viète used the letters $ B $ and $ D $ for the hypotenuses of the first and second triangles, and $ N $ and $ M $ for the perpendicular of the third.

This is also Proposition II.9 from the Arithmetica of Diophantus, but Harriot refers only to Viète's version of it. Zeteticum II Invenire numero duo quadrata, aequalia duobus aliis datis quadratis. To find in numbers two squares equal to two other given squares. One may interpret the problem as asking for two sets of Pythagorean triples with the same third side, or two rational right-angled triangles with the same hypotenuse. Viète called the sides of the first two squares $ B $ and $ D $, and the hypotenuse $ Z $. The words 'synæreseos' and 'diæreseos' were used by Viète and are typical of the Greek terms he frequently introduced into his writing. Harriot followed Viète's working but in his own lower-case notation. Zet. lib. 4. 2. Zetetica, Book IV, Zetetic 2. prop. 2.

Across the top of the page are the terms of a geometric progression with multiplier $ \frac{a}{b} $. 

The rest of the page contains a table of successive squares of the number that may be interpreted as $ .99999999998877 $. 
Selected powers are then added to give $ .99999999998877^{25920000} $. 
A calculation on the following page, Add MS 6782 
, shows that $ 25920000 = 2 \times 60^4 $, that is, the number of half-fifths of a degree in a minute  
(where a degree is subdivided in the traditional way into minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths by successive divisions by 60). 

The entries in the table are calculated in the subsequent pages labelled c.2 to c.7; see:

  The calculation in the upper left corner shows the number of seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths in a minute of a degree.  
  The number of fifths (12960000) is then doubled to give the number of half-fifths (25920000). 
  
  In the upper right corner, Harriot calculates that if 1 minute is represented by 1 mile, 
  a half-fifth of a degree would be represented by $ \frac{1}{432} $ of an inch, a distance that, as he observes, 
  would be invisible.

The numbers in the broad central column, above the horizontal dividing line, form a decreasing geometric progression. 
Harriot used large integers to avoid fractional parts, but if the first number is interpreted as 100, 
the succeeding numbers down to the dividing line represent 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{15}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{14}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{13}{16}} $, ... 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{2}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^0 $. 
The numbers below the dividing line may be interpreted in a similar way as 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{32}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{64}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{1128}} $, ... 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{2048}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{4096}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{8192}} $. 
The numbers marked with asterisks from $ 31.622... $ downwards have been calculated as successive square roots 
in sheets paginated fb.1 to fb.6, in Add MS 6782 
 
to 
. 
Those marked with asterisks in the upper part of the table can be calculated as reciprocals of those in the lower part. 
The numbers in the narrow left-hand column, above the horizontal dividing line, form an increasing arithmetic progression 
with common difference 512. (In the narrow right-hand column, part of the same progression is shown in reverse order.) 
Thus Harriot has matched an arithmetic progression with common difference 512 
to a geometric progression with common ratio $ \frac{1}{{10}^{\frac{1}{16}}} $. 
The matching continues in finer detail below the dividing line for the entries in the geometric progression between 
$ 11.5478... $ and $ 10 $. Such a matching, between an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression, is the 
foundation of any system of logarithms. 
Harriot notes that calculating the numbers in the central column as terms in a geometric progression 
can lead to differences in the final figures as compared with calculating them as square roots. 
The number $ 31,622... $ halfway down the column is written here as it was found by calculation in Add MS 6782 
, 
with the final figures $ ... 683,79 $. Calculating the same entry by multiplication, as part of a geometric progression, 
has instead given Harriot the final figures as $ ... 683,76 $. Similar discrepancies are noted elsewhere.

On this page, as on Add MS 6782 
, Harriot recognizes the usefulness of the triangular numbers 
both for calculating numbers of combinations and for extraction of roots. 
In the note in the bottom right hand corner of the page, Harriot mentions Boethius, Jordanus, and Maurolico 
as writers on figurate numbers. 
His source for both Boethius and Jordanus was probably Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples (Jacob Faber Stapulensis), 
 (1503, 1522), 
which includes a comparison of the 'De institutione' of Boethius with the 'De arithmetica' of Jordanus. 
His source for Maurolico was the  
,  
which he cited several times elsewhere.

all the combinations of 2 letters ($ 7 \times 6 = 42 $), 
of 3 letters ($ 7 \times 6 \times 5 = 210 $), and so on. 
Lines drawn between columns show how figures in a given column are obtained

The figures in column 7, for example, are obtained from those in column 6 by multiplying by 7.

The two words 'on dice' in the title are written in Harriot's Algonquin alphabet 
(see Add MS 6782 
). 
The two tables at the top of the page show the sums that can be obtained on 
(i) two dice (sums ranging from 2 to 12) or (ii) three dice (sums ranging from 3 to 18). 
The three tables in the lower part of the page are frequency tables for the sums on
(iii) two dice;  (iv) three dice ; (v) four dice. 
Tables (iii) and (iv) can be calculated directly from (i) and (ii). 
However, the layout shows that (iv) can also be calculated by taking copies of the totals from (iii), 
staggering their starting position, and then adding; 
this is equivalent to taking the totals from (iii) 
and then adding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, in turn to represent the throw of the third dice. 
For each of (iii), (iv), and (v) the most likely sums are marked with a small cross.

This folio appears to deal with 6 dice numbered as follows: 

first die: 0 0 0 0 0 1 
second die: 0 0 0 0 0 2 
third die: 0 0 0 0 0 3 
fourth die: 0 0 0 0 0 4 
fifth die: 0 0 0 0 0 5 
sixth die: 0 0 0 0 0 6 

The tables show the possible outcomes of throwing the first, then the first and the second, 
then the first and the second and the third, and so on. 
In the table for six dice, for example, we see that combinations with one 0 and five other numbers 
can appear in $ 5 \times 6 = 30 $ ways (since any of the five zeros can appear in any of the six positions). 
Squeezed below and between the main tables are frequency tables showing how many times each sum can appear. 
For six dice, for example, we see that the total 3 can arise in two ways (as 1 + 2 or as 0 + 3) 
giving 3,750 possibilities in total. 
In each of these tables the number of possibilities is summed, giving the appropriate power of 6 in each case.

The tables on this folio appear to have been begun at the top left 
but then re-started and continued along the right-hand edge. 
The tables are calculated in turn for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 throws of a die. 
Take, for example, the fourth table, for four throws of a die. 
The first row indicates that the combination 1111 can occur in only one way. 
The next two rows indicate how many ways only 1 and 2 can occur, distributed as either  
3 + 1  (thus, 1112, 1121, 1211, 2111, 2221, 2212, 2122, 1222), that is, $ 2 \times 4 = 8 $ ways in total, 
or as
2 + 2 (thus, 1122, 1212, 1221, 2112, 2121, 2211), that is, 3 + 3 = 6 ways in total. 
These two calculations are shown in full on Add MS 6782 
. 
The fourth row indicates how many ways only 1, 2, and 3 can occur, 
with any one of them appearing twice (thus 1123, 1132, 1212, 3112, ...), that is, 
$ 4 \times 3 \times 3 = 36 $ ways in total.
Further details of the calculation are shown on Add MS 6782 
. 
The fifth and final row indicates how many ways 1, 2, 3, 4 can appear, that is, 
$ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24 $ ways in total. 
All the other tables are calculated in a similar way. 
Several of the calculations can be seen on Add MS 6782 
. 
Below the line (still reading the page sideways) are two further tables; 
for the continuation of these, see Add MS 6782 
. 
Harriot also includes some brief notes to explain how the tables have been derived.

On this folio Harriot uses the totals he has arrived at on Add MS 6782 
, 
but now extends the calculations to all six numbers on the die. 
As for Add MS 6783, f. 49, we will once again examine the fourth table. 
The first row indicates that a given number can be appear four times in just one way; 
but the given number can be chosen in six ways, so there are $ 1 \times 6 = 6 $ such combinations in total. 
The second row indicates that any two numbers can occur together, with 3 of one and 1 of the other, in 8 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but two numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 8 \times 5 = 120 $ such combinations in total. 
The third row indicates that any two numbers can occur together, with 2 of one and 2 of the other, in 6 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but two numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 6 \times 15 = 90 $ such combinations in total. 
The fourth row indicates that any three numbers can occur together in 36 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but three numbers can be chosen from six in 20 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 36 \times 20 = 720 $ such combinations in total. 
The fifth row indicates that any four numbers can occur together in 24 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but four numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 24 \times 15 = 360 $ such combinations in total. 
As a check on the calculations, Harriot has calculated powers of 6 on the same page. 
It is easily seen from this that each table includes all the possibilities for that number of throws.

In this page. Harriot begins by constructing a table of the interest paid after seven years 
on a capital sum of £$ bb $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{b} $. 
The first row shows the total if the interest is paid yearly (7 payments).  
The second row shows the total if interest is paid twice a year (14 payments). 
The third row shows the total if interest is paid three times a year (21 payments). 
From here, Harriot immediately generalizes to $ n $ payments per year. 
He then (implicitly) allows $ n $ to become very large, indeed infinitely large, 
so that the fractions $ \frac{(n - 1)n}{nn} $, $ \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)n}{nnn} $, ... can all be taken to be 1. 
Harriot then substitutes $ b = 10 $ to obtain the interest on £100 at a rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $, 
paid continuously over seven years. The total comes to £201 7 shillings and 6 pence, 
plus a further fraction that he estimates is not quite $ \frac{7}{100} $ pence. 
(There were 20 shillings (s) to £1, and 12 pence (d) to 1 shillling.) 
This page combines the calculations on the nearby 
 
(interest on £$ b $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{b} $, paid at decreasing intervals) 
with those on 
 
(interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ paid at decreasing intervals and taken to a limit.

After the rough work crossed out at the top, 
the table show the calculation of interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $, 
paid every year for five years. 
The next section is crossed out but the reader is referred by asterisk to an expression lower down the page. 
Here Harriot has written a general formula for the interest paid on £100 
at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ after $ n $ years. 
In the next calculation Harriot has assumed that $ n $ is infinitely large, 
so that the fractions $ \frac{(n - 1)n}{nn} $, $ \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)n}{nnn} $, ... can all be taken to be 1. 
Thus he obtains the interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ paid continuously. 
In calculating the sum, Harriot has drawn a vertical line that cuts off the calculation after 6 terms. 
He notes underneath that £$ \frac{1}{60} = 4 $d (4 pence), that £$ \frac{1}{2400} = \frac{1}{10}$d, 
and that the sum of all the remaining terms will not make up as much as $ \frac{2}{10} $d.

At the beginning of this set of sheets Harriot has written: 'Waste papers of figurate nombers'. 
They are waste only in the sense that they contain rough working. At the same time, 
they show Harriot attempting something highly original, namely, 
finding formulae for sequences of figurate numbers. 
In modern terms, we would say he is fitting third-, fourth- or fifth-degree polynomials 
to numerical sequences. 

At the top is the sequence 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... of sums of squares  
(or of square-pyramidal numbers, see Add MS 6782 
).
Just below that, Harriot has written the polynomial $ 2aaaa + 9aaa + 11a + 2a $, which, it seems, 
is his first attempt to find a formula for the numbers in the sequence, multiplied by 24 
(that is, 24, 120, 336, ...). Putting $ a = 1 $ gives $ 2 + 9 + 11 + 2 $, as required. 
Putting $ a = 2 $, however, gives $ 2 \times 16 + 9 \times 8 + 11 + 4 + 2 \times 4 = 152 $, which is too large. 
This calculation can be seen displayed vertically just below the formula. 
Harriot notes that $ 6 \times 24 = 144 $ falls short of this total by 8. 
Similar trial and error calculations appear on this and several pages that follow.

Examples in the bottom left hand corner rearrange the same coefficients in different orders: 
(2, 10, 8, 4), (8, 10, 2, 4), (8, 2, 10, 4), etc. 
In examples further to the right, the fifth-degree polynomial $ 24a + 50aa + 35aaa + 10aaaa + aaaaa $,

The first reference in the heading is to Michael Stifel's  
, page 15.   
For Stifel, a diagonal number was obtained by multiplying the first two entries of a Pythagorean triple. 
The diagonal number corresponding to the triple (3, 4, 5), for example, is $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $. 
Stifel also defined Pythagorean triples by the ratio of the two shorter sides, in this case $ \frac{4}{3} $. 
He was able to write out two lists, or orders, of triples, 
one with the shorter side odd ($ \frac{4}{3} $, $ \frac{12}{5} $, and so on), 
the other with the shorter side even ($ \frac{15}{8} $, $ \frac{35}{12} $, and so on). 
Stifel claimed that all possible triples were included in these two orders. 
The second reference in the heading, possibly added a little later, is to Johannes Praetorius (Johann Richter), 
 
. On the final page, 
Praetorius discusses the problem of constructing cyclic quadrilaterals with rational sides. 

Harriot sets out to disprove Stifel's claim, by demonstrating the existence of new orders of triples. 
His first order (ordo. 1.) is the same as Stifel's first order. 
The triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. 
This allows Harriot to extrapolate forwards, but also backwards to a starting triple (1, 0, 1). 
The second order (ordo. 2.) is the same as Stifel's second order. 
Again the triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. 
As for the first order this allows Harriot to extrapolate backwards to a starting triple (4, 3, 5). 
This is the first triple of the first order with the first two entries interchanged. 
Perhaps this gave Harriot the idea of interchanging other pairs. 
Thus he begins a third and new order (ordo. 3. novus) with (12, 5, 8), 
which is the second triple from the first order with the first two entries interchanged. 
This order immediately contains (20, 21, 29), which was not included in either of Stifel's orders.  
The fourth order begins with (15, 8, 17), 
which is the first triple from the second order with the first two entries interchanged. 
And so on. By the end of the page, Harriot has six orders, with differences in the left column of 2, 4, 8, 6, 10, 12, 
respectively. 
This seems to suggest to him a more systematic method of displaying the orders, 
which he goes on to do on the next page.

An investigation into Pythagorean triples with hypotenuse 1105. 
Harriot obtains several such triples by multiplication of triples already known. 
Those marked 'supra +' or '+ supra' duplicate others earlier in the list. 
Three triples are identified by Harriot as prime, that is, with no common factors, 
that is, (47, 1104, 1105), (264, 1073, 1105), (576, 943, 1105). 
An error in his 19th order, on Add MS 6782 
, has led him to miss a fourth, (817, 744, 1105).

Throughout the treatise that follows, $ n $ is to be read as a positive integer. 
The table at the top of the page is an array of general triangular numbers: 
the first row and first column contain units, the second row and second column contain lengths, 
the third row and third column contain triangular numbers, the fourth row and fourth column contain pyramidal numbers, 
and so on. 
Between the numbers are signs that combine 'plus' and 'equals', 
illustrating the additive property of the table. 
The numerators and denominators of the fractions are to be read as products. 
Thus $ \frac{789,10,11}{12345} $ in the bottom right-hand corner, for example, is to be read as 
$ \frac{7 \times 8 \times 9 \times 10 \times 11}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5} = 924 $.  
Below the tables Harriot has written general formulae for the numbers in the $ n $th row.

At the top of the page are two difference tables. 
In each case column headed $ g $ may be taken as the starting column. 
Column $ f $ contains successive differences between entries in column $ g $, and so on. 
As elsewhere, a triangle broadening downwards thus, Δ, indicates an increasing column. 
A small square is used to indicate columns of equal entries. 
The central table shows a difference table generated from a constant differenc $ a $. 
Now the lower case letters $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, $ d $, $ f $ represent the first entry of each column 
(the letter $ e $, which for Harriot represented an un unknown quantity, is omitted).  
Harriot has drawn a diagonal line under the table generated from a single entry 
in the constant difference column. 
Two small inset charts to the right of the main table show 
the pattern of increasing and decreasing rows (here they are all increasing) 
and the pattern of signs in each column (here they are all $ + $). 
The lower table contains general formulae for the $ (n + 1) $th entry

the pattern of increasing and decreasing rows (here they are alternately increasing and decreasing) 
and the pattern of signs in each column. 
The lower table contains general formulae for the $ (n + 1) $th entry 
in each column of the difference table, 
using the triangular number coefficients established on page 3 (Add MS 6782 
).

Here Harriot has listed all possible patterns of increasing (c) and decreasing (d) columns

In the lower half of the page, Harriot has produced 32 charts, like those on pages 5 to 7 
(Add MS 6782 
 to 
), showing the sign patterns in the column entries, 
for each pattern of increasing and decreasing columns, for up to six columns. 
The symbols above charts 1 and 32, which look rather like $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $, 
are Harriot's symbols for tangents and secants. 
The symbol $ \upsilon $ above tables 11 and 22 is his symbol for sines. In each case, 
the patterns of c and d columns are those required for the corresponding trigonometric tables.

On the right hand side of the page are three partial difference tables from earlier pages; 
the first and third tables are from page 10 (Add MS 6782 
) while the second is from page 11 (Add MS 6782 
). 
In each case, Harriot has also listed the first entries of the columns of the original difference table, 
denoted by $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, and $ d $. 
On the left hand side are algebraic versions of the same partial difference tables. 
The first table gives formulae for successive second entries 
of the column beginning with $ d $, together with successive differences. 
The second table gives formulae for successive third entries 
of the column beginning with $ d $, together with successive differences. 
The third table gives formulae for succesive $ n $th entries 
of the column beginning with $ d $.  
The final table shows the $ n $th-entry formulae multiplied out, 
with differences calculated between them. 
This demonstrates that the constant difference,

This folio contains a set of formulae for interpolating $ (n - 1) $ new terms between each pair of entries 
in the fourth column of a difference table (the $ D $ column). 
For reasons of space, Harriot has written the entries for the fourth column below those 
for the first, second, and third columns. 
At the bottom of the page, he has written a single general formula for the $ N $th interpolated term 
in the fourth column. This he calls the 'magisterium', which may here be translated as 'rule'. 
Since this formula is expressed entirely in terms of $ n $, $ N $, $ D $, $ C $, $ B $, and $ A $, 
he longer needs to compute $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $.

The symbol $ \frac{N}{n} $ in this context is not a fraction, 
but indicates that the expression to the left of it 
is the $ N $th entry of a table interpolated to $ n $ times its original length. 
The sign )=( may therefore be read as 'indexed by'.

This folio contains the same formulae as page 33 (Add MS 6782

but with $ \frac{N}{n} $ now replaced by $ N $. 
That is, there is no interpolation. 
This page is numbered 1 in its upper righthand corner, 
making it the first in the subsequence of pages 34, 33, 32, and 31 (Add MS 6782

Harriot explained on the next page (Add MS 6782

also numbered 1 in its upper righthand corner, 
that one may begin with the formulae on page 34 (Add MS 6782

then derive the formulae on page 33 (Add MS 6782

That is, one can reverse the sequence of pages 31 to 34. 
As on pages 32 and 33 (Add MS 6782

the sign charts show how to adapt the formulae to different patterns 
of increasing and decreasing columns.

On this and the following folio (Add MS 6782 
), 
Harriot gives numerical examples of his interpolation method. 
At the top of the page are formulae for $ \frac{N}{n} $  and for $ N $, 
for difference tables with two columns. 
Below that are four examples of tables with two columns.  
The table on the left, with columns headed $ N $, $ B $, $ A $, is interpolated 
first to six, then four, then five times the number of original entries; 
that is, $ n $ takes the values 6, then 4, then 5. 
The symbol * next to the interpolated tables marks entries from the original lefthand table. 
Below the tables, the first column of working uses the formula for $ N $ from the top of the page, 
to obtain the entries 17, 77, and 149 in the difference table on the left. 
The second column of working uses the formula for $ \frac{N}{n} $ from the top of the page, 
to obtain one entry in each of the three remaining difference tables. 
The third column of working presents the converse problem, 
showing how to solve for $ N $ (or $ \frac{N}{n} $ ), 
given values of $ A $ and $ B $ and an entry $ Z $. 
Where the solution is not an integer, Harriot replaces $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $.

This folio gives further numerical examples of interpolation for tables with three columns. 
As on page 35 (Add MS 6782 
), Harriot gives the appropriate $ \frac{N}{n} $ and $ N $ formulae 
at the top of the page. The formula in the first line is from page 33 (Add MS 6782 
), 
while the formulae on the second line are from page 32 (Add MS 6782 
). 
The difference table on the left (headed $ N $, $ C $, $ B $, $ A $) is interpolated 
to five times, and then twice, the number of original entries; 
that is $ n $ takes the values 5 and 2, respectively.  
The working in the first column illustrates the use of the formula for $ N $ 
to calculate values in the left hand table. 
The working in the second column illustrates the use of the formula for $ \frac{N}{n} $ 
to calculate the first new value in the second table (indexed $ \frac{1}{5} $), 
and the third new value in the third table (indexed $ \frac{3}{2} $). 
The working in the third column shows, as on page 35 (Add MS 6782 
), how to find $ \frac{N}{n} $ 
given values of $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, and an entry $ Z $. 
In this case the working leads to a quadratic equation for  $ N $, 
which Harriot solves by completing the square. 
As on page 35, the solution is not an integer, and so Harriot replaces $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $.

The two lines at the end of the page have nothing to do with the mathematics above them, 
and are not apparently connected with each other. 

  
is the first line of an epitaph engraved on the tombstone of Edmund Bunny, 
rector of Bolton Percy and canon of York, 
who died in February 1617/8 and was interred in York Minster: 

This is an illustration of synecdoche, in which a part is referred to as the whole; 
thus the pig (lard, here as used to lubricate cobbler's thread) follows the footprints of the iron (needle) 
through the bull (leather); the goose (quill), to whom the cow (inkhorn) provides drink (ink), stains the sheep (skin). 
(The standard version has 
 instead of .) 
 
is an instruction to the student: 'explain and translate'.  
It is possible that  is a play on Percy. 
If the York epitaph was Harriot's source, it gives us a possible date of 1618 for this folio. 

'Bombardagladiofunhastiflammiloquentes'
(Breathing bombs, swords, death, spears, and flames) 
is from a Latin translation by the 16th-century German humanist Martin Crucius of a Greek verse 
(perhaps also by Crucius) consisting of compound words. 
The verse appears in the preface to the  (1583) of Lambert Daneau 
and in the third edition of his  (1592).
The same line appears also in Add MS 6788

In the upper left table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a triangular prism. 
The numbers beneath the sketch are those needed to construct triangular prisms 
with length equal to one side of the base:  $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 6 = 2 \times 3 $, $ 18 = 3 \times 6 $,

These are also the pentagonal-pyramidal numbers 1, 6, 18, ... as calculated in Add MS 6782

Successive sums of these numbers are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right.

In the upper right table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a cube. 
The numbers beneath the sketch are the cube numbers, which can also be thought of 
(in keeping with the previous table) as the numbers needed to construct square prisms 
with height equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 8 = 2 \times 4 $, $ 27 = 3 \times 9 $,

Successive sums are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. 
The column beginning 1, 7, 19, 37, ... is marked 'hexagonae equianguli’ (equiangled hexagons); 
it is possible that at first glance Harriot mistook this column for

Successive sums are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right.

In the lower right table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a hexagonal prism. 
The numbers beneath the sketch are the numbers needed to construct hexagonal prisms 
with length equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 12 = 2 \times 6 $, $ 45 = 3 \times 15 $, 
and so on. 
Successive sums are shown in the column headed to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right.

The formulae at the bottom of the page are for sums of 
triangular, square, pentagonal, and hexagonal prisms. 
Thus the sum of the first two triangular prisms is shown in the upper left table as 1 + 6 = 7. 
The same number may be calculated from the formula $ \frac{3aaaa + 10aaa + 9aa + 2a}{24} $ 
by putting $ a = 2 $. 
For clues as to how Harriot found and tested these formulae,

This folio is a summary of Harriot's calculations on dice. 
The tables on the left, after the page has been turned sideways, 
are frequency tables for the possible sums that can be obtained by throwing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dice  
(see Add MS 6782 
 
and 
).
The totals in each case are the appropriate powers of 6. 
The tables on the right are summaries of the tables that appear on Add MS 6782 
, 
and indicate the number of ways repetitions can occur. 
Amongst the calculations at the bottom right are: 
(i) a table that appears to convert hours to £, at £30 per hour. 
(ii) a conversion of 46,656 shillings (one for each possibility for throws of six dice) into £ and shillings. 
Table (i) is based on £30 or 600 shillings per hour; 
converting shillings to throws of the dice, as suggested by table (ii), 
gives 600 throws per hour, or 10 throws per minute.  
(iii) the ratio of throws with repetitions to throws with no repetition, for six dice, 
namely (see the table above), $ 45,936 : 720 = 63\frac{576}{720} : 1 $.

In modern notation, binomes are numbers of the form $ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ 
where $ m $ and $ n $ are integers. 
In 
, Euclid defined six kinds of binomes, 
according to various relationships of $ m $ to $ n $, 
which for Euclid were geometric lengths. 
In modern notation, the six binomes may be defined as follows. 
Binome 1: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ 7 + \sqrt{48} $. 
Binome 2: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, 
and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{12} + 3 $. 
Binome 3:  a binome of the form$ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{8} + \sqrt{6} $. 
Binome 4: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ 2 + \sqrt{2} $. 
Binome 5: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, 
and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{2} + 1 $. 
Binome 6: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2} $.  
Harriot made two further distinctions for binomes of the fifth and sixth kind according to whether 
$ k $ is itself a square (type i) or not (type (ii). 
In this and the following folio, Add MS 6782 
, 
Harriot shows that the square of any binome is always a binome of the first kind. 
This folio shows his working for first, second, and third binomes.

On this folio Harriot gives rules for finding all the parameters of an arithmetic progression 
given any three of them. 
The three parameters supposed given are listed in the second column, headed 'data', 
where Harriot runs systematically through all the combinations $ pun $, $ pud $, $ pus $, and so on. 
Rules for finding the two remaining quantities in each case are given in the third column, headed 'quaesita'. 
For further details see

This set of pages, lettered  to  is connected to 
Harriot's treatise 'De generatione aequationum canonicarum' in Add MS 6783 
 
to 
. 
On this first page, Harriot works out the multiplications  
$ (a - b)(a - c)(a - d) $, $ (a - b)(a - c)(a + d) $, $ (a - b)(a + c)(a + d) $, 
$ (aa - bb)(a - d) $, $ (aa - bb)(a - d) $, $ (aa + bb)(a - d) $. 
In each case he writes down the values of $ a $ that reduce the resulting product to zero.  
For the second multiplication, for instance, he shows that the product becomes zero when $ a = b $ and $ a = c $ 
but not when $ a = d $.

A continuation from Add MS 6782 
 of work on the equation arising from the multiplication 
$ (a - b)(a - c)(a + d) $. 
Harriot states without proof the special form the equation will take when $ d = b + c $, 
when the term in $ aa $ vanishes. For a full derivation see Add MS 6783 
 (d.3). 
Harriot calls this form of the cubic equation an 'elliptic' or 'Bombellian' equation. 
The special case where $ b = c $ he calls 'parabolic'. 
For Harriot's definitions of the hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic forms 
of a cubic equation without a square term, see Add MS 6783 
 (e.8). 
On this page Harriot also gives the form the equation will take when $ bc = bd + cd $, 
when the term in $ a $ vanishes. For a full derivation see Add MS 6783 
 (d.3).

This page refers to Aristotle's , Books V and VI, 
where Aristotle defines what it means for things to be together or apart, in contact, or continuous. 
The definitions may be paraphrased as follows:

Things are said to be together if they are in one place, apart if they are in different places. 
Things are said to be in contact if their extremities are together. 
Things are said to be continuous if the touching limits of each become one and the same.

This is the first of a set of 12 pages on extracting roots of positively affected equations, 
that is, equations where all the powers following the first are positive. 
Such equations have one, and only one, positive root. 
The work is closely based on Problems 1 to 6 of 
Viète's  
;  
Harriot's heading 'De numerosa potestatum resolutione' directly echoes Viète's.  
The method works by finding each digit of the root in turn. 
Suppose that a required root $ a $ of is of the form $ b + c $, 
where $ b $ represents multiples of 10 and $ c $ represents units.  
The first digit is found by inspection. The canonical form then shows how to estimate $ c $. 
In the problem on this page, for example, Harriot first takes $ b $ to be 40, but quickly finds that this is too large. 
Therefore $ b $ must be 30. Subtracting the known values of $ bb $ (= 900) and $ bd $ (= 720) from 2356 
leaves him with 736, which according to the canonical form must correspond to $ 2bc + cd + cc $. 
A first estimate for $ c $ is found by dividing 736 by $ 2b + d $ (= 84). The integer part of the quotient is 8. 
In fact $ c = 8 $ satisfies the equation $ 2bc + cd + cc = 736 $ exactly and so the process is complete. 
Later examples become more complicated but follow the same basic procedure.

This page demonstrates clearly two kinds of canonical forms used by Harriot in this treatise. 
The first, the 'canonical form for unequal roots' is the general form of an avulsed cubic without a linear term; 
in this case $ b $ and $ c $ are the two positive roots of the equation.  
The second, the 'canonical form for the solution' is the form arrived at by assuming the root $ a $ 
takes the form $ 10b + c $, that is, $ b $ is the first integer in the solution, $ c $ the second. 
Thus the meanings of $ b $ and $ c $ in the two forms are quite different.

On this page Harriot begins a general treatment of equations of the form $ xxz = dda - aaa $,

similarly $ dd $ is a placeholder for a 2-dimensional quantity, not necessarily a square.

Equations of this kind have two positive roots or none at all, depending on the size of $ xxz $.

This is the first of a set of 18 pages on extracting roots of avulsed equations, 
that is, equations containing three terms, in which the term of highest degree is subtracted 
(torn away, or 'avulsed') from the term of next higest degree.  
Such equations have two positive roots. It is therefore important to know the relative sizes of the roots 
before beginning extraction by numerical methods. This is the problem Harriot investigated in this section. 
The work is closely based on Problems 16 to 20 in 
Viète, , 
. 
Viète gave rules for finding the second positive root once the first is known, but without explanation. 
In this section, Harriot fills in the missing details, showing how the two positive roots 
are related to the coefficients of the original equation and to each other.

$ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second line, 
$ H $ for the gvien difference,

This is the first of several pages in which Harriot worked on Zetetica 7 to 10 from Book I of Viète's 
 
. 
Harriot at first treated the problems exactly as Viète had done, using the geometric language in which the word 
 represents an unknown line, side, or root. 
However, in each case Harriot then switched from geometry to arithmetic, 
treating the known and unknown quantities as numbers rather than geometrical quantities.

This page contains Harriot's working of Zetetic 7.

Viète used the letter $ B $ for the whole line, 
$ D $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the first part to the first segment, 
$ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second segment, 
$ H $ for the prescribed sum, 
and $ A $ and $ E $ for the parts of the first and second segments. 
Harriot repeated Viète's working in his own notation, and also added some variants of his own. 
The numbers at the bottom of the page are taken from Viète. 
On Add MS 6782 
, Harriot worked the same problem with further numerical examples.

This page contains Harriot's working of Zetetic 4 from Book I of Viète's

Viète used the letters $ B $ and $ D $ for the two roots, and $ R $ to $ S $ for the ratio of the defects. 
Harriot repeated Viète's working, including his alternative method ('Aliter'),in his own notation. 
The symbol that looks like a modern = sign is to be read as a minus sign, 
used by Harriot (following Viète) in cases where it was not known which quantity was greater. 
Thus, $ a = b $ is to be read as '$ a - b $ or $ b - a $, whichever is positive'. 
In modern notation the same result is represented by $ |a - b| $.

This page contains a lemma needed for Zetetic 10 from Book II of Viète's 
 
.

Viète called the given side $ D $, and the side to be found $ A - \frac{1}{2}D $, 
and arrived at the following conclusion: 

Borrowing Viète's notation, his statement may be written as the identity 
$ (A - \frac{1}{2}D)^2 + D^2 + (DA - \frac{1}{2}D^2) = A^2 $. 
On this page Harriot investigated the problem geometrically. 
On Add MS 6782 
, he treated it algebraically.

This page is one of the few that contains a date: 29 August 1600. 
The date is consistent with the suggestion that Harriot's friend Nathaniel Torporley met Viète in person 
in Paris in the late 1590s, and brought Viète's books back to England (see 
. 
This appears to be the first of several pages in which Harriot worked systematically through Viète's
 
, 
re-writing the propositions and proofs in his own notation. 
He began here with Zetetics 2 and 3 from Book 1 
; 
Zetetic 1 is sketched in outline on Add MS 6782 
. 
He reached the end of Book I nine days later on 6 September (see Add MS 6782 
.)

Viète used the letters $ A $ and $ E $ for the two roots, and $ R $ to $ S $ for their ratio. 
Harriot repeated Viète's working in his own notation.

This is also Proposition II.9 from the  of Diophantus,

One may interpret the problem as asking for two sets of Pythagorean triples with the same third side, 
or two rational right-angled triangles with the same hypotenuse. 
Viète called the sides of the first two squares $ B $ and $ D $, and the hypotenuse $ Z $. 
The words 'synæreseos' and 'diæreseos' were used by Viète and are typical of the Greek terms 
he frequently introduced into his writing.
